	debugging enabled.
	Put MinGW32 checks in place, thus it is now possible to cross-
	compile the qucs package using a GNU/Linux box.  Had to separate
	LDFLAGS and LIBS because linker command line order matters (-lqt-mt
	-lqtmain *must* be at the end of the command line), otherwise
	linking fails.  Changed rules in appropriate Makefile.am's.
	Additionally checking for the 'ar' tool.
