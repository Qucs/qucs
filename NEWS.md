   resistor in the schematic.


Interfaces
----------

 * Improved Qucs/Octave interface for GUI and Qucssator netlist entry (including a start
   on a Octave library of plotting functions for Qucs post simulation data visualization)

 * First steps in developing a combined Qucs/Python Qucs simulation capability with
   high quality date visualization using matplolib. Applications include basic sensitivity analysis
   and circuit performance optimisation.

 * Preliminary version of Qucs/Octave linked transient simulation capability.
