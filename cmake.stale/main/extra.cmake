## Now the work of copying dependencies into the bundle/package The quotes are
## escaped and variables to use at install time have their $ escaped An

## ...). Note that the image plugins depend on QtSvg and QtXml, and it got those
## copied over.

## To Create a package, one can run "cpack -G DragNDrop CPackConfig.cmake" on Mac
## OS X where CPackConfig.cmake is created by including CPack And then there's
## ways to customize this as well set(CPACK_BINARY_DRAGNDROP ON) include(CPack)
