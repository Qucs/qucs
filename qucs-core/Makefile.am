## Test suite
#  Run with: make check
# These tests rely on the assert and bugon functions.
# The functions are used as equations on the schematic.
# Fail on these functions will abort the simulation of netlist generated
# from the schematic.
#
# See also qucs-test for another way of testing.
# https://github.com/Qucs/qucs-test.
