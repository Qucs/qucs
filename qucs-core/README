Description
===========

Qucsator is a command line circuit simulator.  It takes a network
list in a certain format as input and outputs a Qucs dataset.  It has
been programmed for usage in the Qucs project but can also be used by
other applications.

Requirements
============

Currently there are no dependencies on other software projects.

Installation
============

Unpack the distribution tarball:

    $ tar xvzf qucs-core-<version>.tar.gz               (using GNU tar)
    $ gzip -cd qucs-core-<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -   (using another tar)
  
Change into the source directory:

    $ cd qucs-core-<version>

Configure the source package for your system:

    $ ./configure

Now compile the package:

    $ make

Install Qucsator:

    $ make install

You must have root privileges if you want to install the package in the
standard location (/usr/local) or in any location that is only writable 
by root.

For further information on installing the package, please consult the
file INSTALL included in this distribution.

Please note:  Users of the FreeBSD OS may use a GNU make (probably gmake)
to compile and install the package.

Getting the latest SVN snapshot
===============================

You can always get the latest Qucsator version from our SVN
repository.  Please use an official release if you want to work with
Qucsator.  The SVN version might not even compile.

    $ svn co https://qucs.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/qucs/trunk/qucs-core

Press 'Enter' when asked for a password.  Run `sh bootstrap' and
`configure' with the appropriate options.  Maintainance currently
requires Autoconf version 2.57 and GNU automake 1.7.0.
