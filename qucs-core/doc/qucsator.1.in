.SH NAME
Qucsator \- An integrated electronic circuit simulator.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qucsator
[\fIOPTION\fR] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBQucs\fR is an integrated circuit simulator which means you are able
to setup a circuit with a graphical user interface (GUI) and simulate
the large-signal, small-signal and noise behaviour of the circuit.
After that simulation has finished you can view the simulation results
on a presentation page or window.

The software aims to support all kinds of circuit simulation types,
e.g. DC, AC, S-parameter, harmonic balance analysis, noise analysis,
etc.

\fBQucsator\fR, the simulation backend, is a command line circuit
simulator.  It takes a network list in a certain format as input and
outputs a Qucs dataset.  It has been programmed for usage in the Qucs
project but may also be used by other applications.
