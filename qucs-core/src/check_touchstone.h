/* Touchstone (R) File Format Specification Rev 1.1

   A Touchstone (R) file (also known as an SnP file) is an ASCII text file
   used for documenting the n-port network parameter data of an active
   device or passive interconnect network.  While Touchstone file have
   been accepted as a de-facto standard for the transfer of frequency
   dependent n-port network data, up till now there has been no formal
   documentation of the file format or syntax.  This document, base upon
   information from Agilent Corporation (the originator of Touchstone), is
   a formal specification of the Touchstone file format, intended for use
   with documents and specifications produced by the EIA/IBIS Open Forum. */
