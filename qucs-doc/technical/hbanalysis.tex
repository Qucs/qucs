\chapter{Harmonic Balance Analysis}
\label{sec:hb_analysis}

Harmonic balance is a non-linear, frequency-domain, steady-state
simulation.  The voltage and current sources create discrete
frequencies resulting in a spectrum of discrete frequencies at every
node in the circuit. Linear circuit components are solely modeled in
frequency domain. Non-linear components are modeled in time domain and
Fourier-transformed before each solving step.  The information in
this chapter are taken from \cite{Maas1} (chapter 3) which is a very
nice and well-written publication on this topic.

\addvspace{12pt}

The harmonic balance simulation is ideal for situations where
transient simulation methods are problematic. These are:
\begin{itemize}
\item components modeled in frequency domain, for instance (dispersive)
      transmission lines
\item circuit time constants large compared to period of simulation
      frequency
\item circuits with lots of reactive components
\end{itemize}
Harmonic balance methods, therefore, are the best choice for most microwave
circuits excited with sinusoidal signals (e.g. mixers, power amplifiers).


\section{The Basic Concept}

As the non-linear elements are still modeled in time domain, the circuit
first must be separated into a linear and a non-linear part. The
internal impedances $Z_i$ of the voltage sources are put into the
linear part as well. Figure \ref{fig:hb_concept} illustrates the
concept. Let us define the following symbols:
\begin{description}
\item[] M = number of (independent) voltage sources
\item[] N = number of connections between linear and non-linear subcircuit
\item[] K = number of calculated harmonics
\item[] L = number of nodes in linear subcircuit
\end{description}

The linear circuit is modeled by two transadmittance matrices:
The first one $\tilde{\boldsymbol{Y}}$
relates the source voltages $v_{S,1}...v_{S,M}$ to the interconnection
currents $i_1...i_N$ and the second one $\hat{\boldsymbol{Y}}$
relates the interconnection
voltages $v_1...v_N$ to the interconnection currents $i_1...i_N$.
Taking both, we can express the current flowing through the
interconnections between linear and non-linear subcircuit:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:HBlin}
\boldsymbol{I}
  = \boldsymbol{\tilde{Y}}_{N\times M}\cdot \boldsymbol{V}_S +
    \boldsymbol{\hat{Y}}_{N\times N}\cdot \boldsymbol{V}
  = \boldsymbol{I}_S + \boldsymbol{\hat{Y}}\cdot \boldsymbol{V}
\end{equation}
Because $\boldsymbol{V}_S$ is known and constant, the first term
can already be computed to give $\boldsymbol{I}_S$. Taking the
whole linear network as one block is called the "piecewise"
harmonic balance technique.

\addvspace{12pt}

The non-linear circuit is modeled by its current function
$i(t) = f_g(v_1, ..., v_P)$
and by the charge of its capacitances
$q(t) = f_q(v_1, ..., v_Q)$.
These functions must be Fourier-transformed to give the
frequency-domain vectors $\boldsymbol{Q}$ and $\boldsymbol{I}_G$,
respectively.

\addvspace{12pt}

A simulation result is found if the currents through the
interconnections are the same for the linear and the non-linear
subcircuit. This principle actually gave the harmonic balance
simulation its name, because through the interconnections the
currents of the linear and non-linear subcircuits have to be
\textit{balanced} at every \textit{harmonic} frequency. To
be precise the described method is called Kirchhoff's current
law harmonic balance (KCL-HB). Theoretically, it would also be
possible to use an algorithm that tries to balance the voltages
at the subcircuit interconnections. But then the Z matrix (linear
subcircuit) and current-dependent voltage laws (non-linear
subcircuit) have to be used. That doesn't fit the need (see other
simulation types).

\addvspace{12pt}

So, the non-linear equation system that needs to be solved writes:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:HBeqn}
\textbf{F}(\textbf{V})
  = \underbrace{(\boldsymbol{I}_S) + (\boldsymbol{\hat{Y}})\cdot (\boldsymbol{V})}_{\text{linear}}
  + \underbrace{j\cdot \boldsymbol{\Omega}\cdot \boldsymbol{Q} + \boldsymbol{I}_G}_{\text{non-linear}}
  = \boldsymbol{0}
\end{equation}
where matrix $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$ contains the angular frequencies
on the first main diagonal and zeros anywhere else, $\boldsymbol{0}$
is the zero vector.

\addvspace{12pt}

After each iteration step, the inverse Fourier transformation must
be applied to the voltage vector $\boldsymbol{V}$. Then the time domain
voltages $v_{0,1}...v_{K,N}$ are put into $i(t) = f_g(v_1, ..., v_P)$
and $q(t) = f_q(v_1, ..., v_Q)$ again. Now, a Fourier transformation
gives the vectors $\boldsymbol{Q}$ and $\boldsymbol{I}_G$ for the
next iteration step. After repeating this several times, a simulation
result has hopefully be found.

\addvspace{12pt}

Having found this result means having got the voltages $v_1...v_N$ at
the interconnections of the two subcircuits. With these values the
voltages at all nodes can be calculated: Forget about the non-linear
subcircuit, put current sources at the former interconnections (using
the calculated values) and perform a normal AC simulation. After that
the simulation is complete.

\addvspace{12pt}

A short note to the construction of the quantities: One big difference
between the HB and the conventional simulation types like a DC or an
AC simulation is the structure of the matrices and vectors. A vector
used in a conventional simulation contains one value for each node.
In an HB simulation there are many harmonics and thus, a vector contains
$K$ values for each node. This means that within a matrix, there is a
$K \times K$ diagonal submatrix for each node. Using this structure,
all equations can be written in the usual way, i.e. without paying
attention to the special matrix and vector structure. In a computer
program, however, a special matrix class is needed in order to not
waste memory for the off-diagonal zeros.


\section{Going through each Step}

\subsection{Creating Transadmittance Matrix}

It needs several steps to get the transadmittance matrices $[\tilde{Y}]$
and $[\hat{Y}]$ mentioned in equation \eqref{eqn:HBlin}. First the MNA
matrix of the linear subcircuit (figure \ref{fig:hb_concept}) is created
(chapter \ref{sec:MNA}) without the voltage sources $S_1$...$S_M$ and
without the non-linear components. Note that all nodes must appear in the
matrix, even those where only non-linear components are connected. Then
the transimpedance matrix is derived by
exciting one by one the port nodes of the MNA matrix with unity current.
After that the transadmittance matrix is calculated by inverting the
transimpedance matrix. Finally the matrices $[\tilde{Y}]$ and $[\hat{Y}]$
are filled with the corresponding elements of the overall transadmittance
matrix.

\addvspace{12pt}

Note: The MNA matrix of the linear subcircuit has $L$ nodes.
Every node, that is connected to the non-linear subcircuit or/and is
connected to a voltage source, is called "port" in the following text.
So, there are $M+N$ ports. All these ports need to be differential
ones, i.e. without ground reference. Otherwise problems may occur
due to singular matrices when calculating $[\tilde{Y}]$ or $[\hat{Y}]$.

\addvspace{12pt}

Now this should be described in more detail: By use of the MNA matrix
$[A]$, the $n$-th column of the transimpedance matrix $[Z]$ should be
calculated. The voltage source at port $n$ is connected to node $i$
(positive terminal) and to node $j$ (negative terminal). This results
in the following equation. (If port $n$ is referenced to ground, the
-1 is simply omitted.)
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:HBtrans}
[A]\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
V_1\\
\vdots\\
V_L\\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0\\
\vdots\\
1\\
\vdots\\
-1\\
\vdots\\
0\\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{matrix}
 \\
 \\
\leftarrow i\text{-th row}\\
 \\
\leftarrow j\text{-th row}\\
 \\
 \\
\end{matrix}
\end{equation}
After having solved it, $Z_{1,n}$...$Z_{N+M,n}$ are obtained
simply by subtraction of the node voltages:
\begin{equation}
Z_{m,n} = V_k - V_l
\end{equation}
Here the voltage source at port $m$ is connected to node $k$
(positive terminal) and to node $l$ (negative terminal).

\addvspace{12pt}

The next column of $[Z]$ is obtained by changing the right-hand
side of equation \eqref{eqn:HBtrans} appropriately. As this has to
be done $N+M$ times, it is strongly recommended to use LU
decomposition.

\addvspace{12pt}

As $[\tilde{Y}]$ is not square, problems encounter by trying to
build its inverse matrix. Therefore, the following procedure is
recommended:
\begin{itemize}
\item Create the transimpedance matrix for all ports (sources
  and interconnections).
\item Compute the inverse matrix (transadmittance matrix).
\item The upper left and upper right corner contains $[\tilde{Y}]$
  and $[\hat{Y}]$.
\item The lower left and lower right corner contains the transadmittance
  matrices to calculate the currents through the sources. They
  can be used to simplify the AC simulation at the very end.
\end{itemize}


\addvspace{12pt}

One further thing must be mentioned: Because the non-linear
components and the sources are missing in the linear MNA matrix,
there are often components that are completely disconnected from
the rest of the circuit. The resulting MNA matrix cannot be
solved. To avoid this problem, shunt each port with a $100\Omega$
resistor, i.e. place a resistor in parallel to each non-linear
component and to each source. The effect of these resistors can
be easily removed by subtracting 10mS from the first main diagonal
of the transadmittance matrix.


\subsection{Starting Values}

A difficult question is how to find appropriate start values for the
harmonic balance simulation. It is recommended to first perform a DC
analysis and start the algorithm with this result. In many situation
(perhaps always) an even better starting point can be achieved by
also using the result of a linear AC simulation. However with a large
signal strength and strong non-linearities, convergence may still
fail. Then, the following procedure might succeed: Perform HB
simulation by applying half of the desired signal levels. If convergence
is reached, the result can be used as start values for the simulation
with the full signal levels. Otherwise the amplitude of the signals can
be further decreased in order to repeat the above-mentioned procedure.


\subsection{Solution algorithm}

To perform a HB simulation, the multi-dimensional, non-linear function
\ref{eqn:HBeqn} has to be solved. One of the best possibilities to
do so is the Newton method:
\begin{equation}
\textbf{V}_{n+1} = \textbf{V}_n - \textbf{J}_F (\textbf{V}_n)^{-1}
                   \cdot \textbf{F} (\textbf{V}_n)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:HBnewton}
\Rightarrow \qquad \textbf{J}_F (\textbf{V}_n) \cdot \textbf{V}_{n+1}
    = \textbf{J}_F (\textbf{V}_n) \cdot \textbf{V}_n - \textbf{F} (\textbf{V}_n)
\end{equation}
with $\textbf{J}_F$ being the Jacobian matrix. DC and transient
simulation also use this technique, but here a problem appears:
The derivatives of the component models are not given in frequency
domain. Thus, the Jacobian must be calculated starting at the HB
equation \ref{eqn:HBeqn}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:HBjacobi}
\boldsymbol{J}_F (\boldsymbol{V}_n) = \frac{d\boldsymbol{F} (\boldsymbol{V})}{d\boldsymbol{V}}
    = \boldsymbol{\hat{Y}}_{N \times N} + \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{I}_G}{\partial \boldsymbol{V}}
     + j\cdot \boldsymbol{\Omega}\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{Q}}{\partial \boldsymbol{V}}
    = \boldsymbol{\hat{Y}}_{N \times N} + \boldsymbol{J}_{F,G}
     + j\cdot \boldsymbol{\Omega}\cdot\boldsymbol{J}_{F,Q}
\end{equation}
So, two Jacobian matrices have to be built, one for the current
$\boldsymbol{I}_G$ and one for the charge $\boldsymbol{Q}$. Both resulted
from a Fourier Transformation. The two operations (Fourier Transformation
and differentiation) are linear and thus, can be exchanged. Hence, the
Jacobian matrices
are built in time domain and transformed into frequency domain afterwards.

\addvspace{12pt}

To obtain a practical algorithm of this procedure, the DFT is best written
as matrix equation. By having a look at equation \ref{eqn:DFT} and
\ref{eqn:IDFT}, it becomes clear how this works. The harmonic factors
$\exp(j\omega_k t_n)$ build the matrix $\boldsymbol{\Gamma}$:
\begin{align}
\text{DFT:}  \qquad & \boldsymbol{U}(j\omega) = \boldsymbol{\Gamma}\cdot \boldsymbol{u}(t) \\
\text{IDFT:} \qquad & \boldsymbol{u}(t) = \boldsymbol{\Gamma}^{-1}\cdot \boldsymbol{U}(j\omega)
\end{align}
with $\boldsymbol{u}$ and $\boldsymbol{U}$ being the vectors of the time
and frequency values, respectively. Now, it is possible to transform the
desired Jacobian matrix into frequency domain:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:HB_jacobi}
\boldsymbol{J}_{F,G}
  = \frac{\partial\boldsymbol{I}_G}{\partial\boldsymbol{V}}
  = \frac{\partial(\boldsymbol{\Gamma}\cdot\boldsymbol{i})}
         {\partial(\boldsymbol{\Gamma}\cdot\boldsymbol{v})}
  = \boldsymbol{\Gamma}\cdot\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{i}}{\partial\boldsymbol{v}}
    \cdot\boldsymbol{\Gamma}^{-1}
\end{equation}
Here $\boldsymbol{i}$ is a vector with length $K\cdot N$, i.e. first all
time values of the first node are inserted, then all time values of the
second node etc. The Jacobi matrix of $\boldsymbol{i}$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{J}_{F,G}(\boldsymbol{u}) =
\begin{bmatrix}
\dfrac{\partial i_1}{\partial u_1} & \hdots & \dfrac{\partial i_1}{\partial u_n} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
\dfrac{\partial i_n}{\partial u_1} & \hdots & \dfrac{\partial i_n}{\partial u_n} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
Hence this matrix consists of
$K \times K$ blocks (one for each node) that are diagonal matrices with
time values of the derivatives in it. (Components exists that create
non-diagonal blocks, but these are so special ones that they do not appear
in this document.)

\addvspace{12pt}

The formula \ref{eqn:HB_jacobi} seems to be quite clear, but it has to be pointed out how
this works with FFT algorithm. With
$\boldsymbol{\Gamma}^{-1} = (\boldsymbol{\Gamma}^{-1})^T$
(see equation \ref{eqn:IDFT}) and
$(\boldsymbol{A}\cdot\boldsymbol{B})^T = \boldsymbol{B}^T\cdot \boldsymbol{A}^T$,
it follows:
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{J}_{F,G}
  = \boldsymbol{\Gamma}\cdot\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{i}}{\partial\boldsymbol{v}}
    \cdot\boldsymbol{\Gamma}^{-1}
  = \left( \boldsymbol{\Gamma}^{-1}\cdot \left( \boldsymbol{\Gamma} \cdot
    \frac{\partial\boldsymbol{i}}{\partial\boldsymbol{v}} \right)^T \right)^T
\end{equation}
So, there are two steps to perform an FFT-based transformation of the time
domain Jacobian matrix into the frequency domain Jacobian:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Perform an FFT on every column of the Jacobian and build a new matrix
      $\boldsymbol{A}$ with this result, i.e. the first column of
      $\boldsymbol{A}$ is the FFTed first column of the Jacobian and so on.
\item Perform an IFFT on every row of the matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ and build
      a new matrix $\boldsymbol{B}$ with this result, i.e. the first row of
      $\boldsymbol{B}$ is the IFFTed first row of $\boldsymbol{A}$ and so on.
\end{enumerate}
As the Fourier transformation has to be applied to diagonal sub-matrices,
the whole above-mentioned process can be performed by one single FFT. This
is done by taking the $\partial\boldsymbol{i} / \partial\boldsymbol{v}$
values in a vector $\boldsymbol{J}_i$ and calculating:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:sMatFFT}
\dfrac{1}{K}\cdot\text{FFT}\left(\boldsymbol{J}_i\right)
\end{equation}
The result is the first column of $\boldsymbol{J}_{F,G}$. The second column
equals the first one rotated down by one element. The third column is the
second one rotated down by one element etc. A matrix obeying this structure
is called Toeplitz matrix.

\addvspace{12pt}

So, finally the complete HB Newton iteration step can be written down.
Putting \ref{eqn:HBeqn} and \ref{eqn:HBjacobi} into  \ref{eqn:HBnewton}
leads to
\begin{equation}
\textbf{J}_F (\textbf{V}_n) \cdot \textbf{V}_{n+1}
  = \textbf{J}_{F,G} \cdot \textbf{V}_n - \textbf{I}_G +
    j\cdot \boldsymbol{\Omega}\cdot (\textbf{J}_{F,Q}\cdot\textbf{V}_n - \textbf{Q}) -
    \textbf{I}_S
\end{equation}
This is important to notice, because many non-linear components
cannot be processed at every bias point (see figure \ref{fig:NewtonBad}).
These components create a new voltage estimate across their nodes,
whereas the new estimated absolute voltages at their nodes are not
known. Thus, the term $\textbf{J}_{F,G} \cdot \textbf{V}_n$ can
only be created in one single step, leading to the vector
$\textbf{I}_{G,J}$. Luckily, this procedure also saves computation
time, as the matrix multiplication need not to be performed.
The same is true for the term $\textbf{J}_{F,Q}\cdot\textbf{V}_n$,
leading to the vector $\textbf{Q}_J$. So it is:
\begin{equation}
\textbf{J}_F \cdot \textbf{V}_{n+1}
  = \textbf{I}_{G,J} - \textbf{I}_G +
    j\cdot \boldsymbol{\Omega}\cdot (\textbf{Q}_J - \textbf{Q}) -
    \textbf{I}_S
\end{equation}


\subsection{Termination Criteria}

Frequency components with very different magnitude appear in harmonic
balance simulation. In order to detect when the solver has found an
accurate solution, an absolute as well as relative criteria must be
used on all nodes and at all frequencies. The analysis is regarded as
finished if one of the criteria is satisfied.

\addvspace{12pt}

The absolute and relative criteria write as follows:
\begin{align}
\left| \tilde{I}_{n,k} + \hat{I}_{n,k} \right| &< \varepsilon_{abs}
   &\forall \quad n, k\\
2\cdot \left| \frac{\tilde{I}_{n,k} + \hat{I}_{n,k}}
                   {\tilde{I}_{n,k} - \hat{I}_{n,k}} \right|
  &< \varepsilon_{rel}  &\forall \quad n, k
\end{align}
where $\tilde{I}_{n,k}$ is the current of the linear circuit
partition for node $n$ and frequency $k$ and $\hat{I}_{n,k}$
is the current of the non-linear circuit partition.


\section{A Symbolic HB Algorithm}

In this final section, a harmonic balance algorithm in symbolic language is
presented.

\addvspace{12pt}

 Y = calcTransMatrix();     // transadmittance matrix of linear circuit
 Is = calcSourceCurrent();  // source current of linear subcircuit
 (v, i, q) = calculateDC(); // DC simulation as initial HB estimate
 V = FFT(v);                // transform voltage into frequency domain

 loop:
   I = FFT(i);                       // current into frequency domain
   Q = FFT(q);                       // charge into frequency domain
   E = Is + Y*V + j*$\Omega$*Q + I;          // HB equation
   if (abs(E) < Eterm) break;       // convergence reached ?
   JG = mFFT(GJacobian(v));          // create Jacobians and transform...
   JQ = mFFT(QJacobian(v));          // ... them into frequency domain
   J = Y + j*$\Omega$*JQ + JG;               // calculate overall Jacobian
   V = V - invert(J) * E;            // Newton Raphson iteration step
   v = IFFT(V);                      // voltage into time domain
   i = nonlinearCurrent(v);          // use component models to get...
   q = nonlinearCharge(v);           // ... values for next iteration
   goto loop;

 Va = invert(Ya) * Ia;               // AC simulation to get all voltages
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Large-Signal S-Parameter Simulation}

Using harmonic balance techniques, it is also possible to perform
an S-parameter simulation in the large-signal regime. This is called
LSSP (large-signal s-parameter). Figure \ref{fig:lssp} shows the
principle. The port $n$ excites the circuit with the simulation
frequency $f_0$; meanwhile the power of all other ports is set to
zero. Having voltage and current of the fundamental frequency $f_0$
at the ports, the S-parameters can be calculated:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:ui2s}
\underline{S}_{mn} = \frac{\underline{U}_m(f_0) - \underline{I}_m(f_0)\cdot Z_m}
                          {\underline{U}_n(f_0) + \underline{I}_n(f_0)\cdot Z_n}
		\cdot \sqrt{\frac{Z_n}{Z_m}}
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{lssp}
\end{center}
\caption{S-parameter from AC voltages and currents}
\label{fig:lssp}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

An algorithm in symbolic language should describe the whole LSSP:

\addvspace{12pt}

  Set power of ports $\ne n$ to 0.
  Perform Harmonic Balance.

  for m=1 to $NumberOfPorts$
    Calculate $\underline{S}_{mn}$ according to above-mentioned equation.
}
\end{lstlisting}


\section{Autonomous Harmonic Balance}

Up to here, only forced circuits were dealt with. That is, the
above-mentioned methods can analyse circuits that are driven by
signal sources, but do not create a signal by themselves. The
typical examples are amplifiers and mixers. However, harmonic
balance techniques are also capable of simulating autonomous
circuits like oscillators.\\
This is mostly done in the following way:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The user enters an approximate frequency, where the oscillation
  is expected. (An ac simulation can be performed to get an idea about
  that.)
\item The user enters a frequency interval. Somewhere within this
  interval the oscillation must appear.
\item The user specifies a circuit node where the oscillation voltage
  can best be measured.
\item The simulator performs several harmonic balance analyses with
  different fundamental frequencies in search for the oscillation.
\end{enumerate}
