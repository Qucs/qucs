\chapter{Harmonic Balance Noise Analysis}
\label{sec:hb_noise}

Once a harmonic balance simulation is solved a cyclostationary
noise analysis can
be performed. This results in the sideband noise of each harmonic
(including DC, i.e. base band noise). The method described here
is based on the principle of small-signal noise. That is, the
noise power is assumed small enough (compared to the signal power
and its harmonics) to neglect the higher order mixing products.
This procedure is the standard concept in CAE and allows for a
quite simple and time-saving algorithm: Use the Jacobian to
calculate a conversion matrix and then apply the noise correlation
matrix to it. Two important publications for HB noise simulation
exist that were used for the next subsection \cite{Roychowdhury},
\cite{Rizzoli}.

Figure \ref{fig:hbn_concept} shows the equivalent circuit for
starting the HB noise analysis. At every connection between
linear and non-linear subcircuit, there are two noise current
sources: one stemming from the linear subcircuit and one
stemming from the non-linear subcircuit.

\section{The Linear Subcircuit}

The noise stemming from the linear subcircuit is calculated
in two steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item An AC noise analysis (see section \ref{sec:acnoise_algo}) is
   performed for the interconnecting nodes of linear and non-linear
   subcircuit. This results in the noise-voltage correlation matrix
   $(\boldsymbol{\underline{C}}_{Z,lin})_{N\times N}$.
\item The matrix $(\boldsymbol{\underline{C}}_{Z,lin})_{N\times N}$
   is converted into a noise-current correlation matrix (see section
   \ref{sec:noiseTrans}):
   \begin{equation}
     (\boldsymbol{\underline{C}}_{Y,lin})_{N\times N} =
     \boldsymbol{\hat{Y}} \cdot
     \boldsymbol{\underline{C}}_{Z,lin} \cdot
     \boldsymbol{\hat{Y}}^+
   \end{equation}
   where $\boldsymbol{\hat{Y}}$ is taken from equation \ref{eqn:HBeqn}.
\end{enumerate}

Remark: If no explicit noise sources exist in the linear subcircuit,
$(\boldsymbol{\underline{C}}_{Z,lin})_{N\times N}$ can be computed
much faster by using Bosma's theorem (equation \ref{eqn:bosma}).


\section{The Non-Linear Subcircuit}

The noise in the non-linear part of the circuit is calculated
by using the quasi-static approach, i.e. for every moment in
time the voltages and currents are regarded as a time-dependent
bias point. The noise properties of these bias points are
used for the noise calculation.

\addvspace{12pt}

Remark: It is not clear whether this approach creates a valid result
for noise with long-time correlation (e.g. 1/f noise), too. But up
to now, no other methods were proposed and some publications
reported to have achieved reasonable results with this approach
and 1/f noise.

\addvspace{12pt}

Calculating the noise-current correlation matrix $(\underline{C}_{Y,nl})_{N\times N}$
needs several steps. The DC bias point taken from the result of the
HB simulation is the beginning. Its values are the bias used to build
the correlation matrix $(\underline{C}_{Y,DC})$. Each part is a $K\times K$
diagonal submatrix. The values are the power-spectral densities (PSD)
for each harmonic frequency:
\begin{equation}
C_{Y,DC}(\omega_R) \qquad C_{Y,DC}(\omega_0 + \omega_R) \qquad
C_{Y,DC}(2\cdot\omega_0 + \omega_R) \qquad \dots
\end{equation}
where $\omega_R$ is the desired noise frequency.

\addvspace{12pt}

The second step creates the cyclostationary modulation that is applied
to the DC correlation matrix. The modulation factor $M(t)$ originates
from the current power spectral density $S_i$ of each time step
normalized to its DC bias value:
\begin{equation}
M(t) = \dfrac{S_i\left( u(t) \right)}{S_i(u_{DC})}
     = \dfrac{S_i\left( u(t) \right)}{C_{Y,DC}}
\end{equation}
Note that this equation only holds if the frequency dependency of
$S_i$ is the same for every bias, so that $M(t)$ is frequency
independent. This demand is fulfilled for all practical models.
So the above-mentioned equation can be derived for an arbitrary
noise frequency $\omega_R$.

\addvspace{12pt}

The third step transforms $M(t)$ into frequency domain. This is done
by the procedure described in equation \ref{eqn:sMatFFT}, resulting
in a Toeplitz matrix.\\
The fourth and final step calculates the desired correlation matrix:
\begin{equation}
(\underline{C}_{Y,nl}) = M \cdot (\underline{C}_{Y,DC}) \cdot M^+
\end{equation}


\section{Noise Conversion}

As the noise of linear and non-linear components are uncorrelated,
the noise-voltage correlation matrix at the interconnecting ports
can now be calculated:

\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{C_Z} = \boldsymbol{J}_F^{-1} \cdot (\boldsymbol{C}_{Y,lin} + \boldsymbol{C}_{Y,nl})
       \cdot (\boldsymbol{J}_F^{-1})^+
\end{equation}

here $\boldsymbol{J}_F^{-1}$ is the inverse of the Jacobian matrix taken
from the last HB iteration step (where it already was inverted). Note
that it needs to be the precise Jacobian matrix. I.e. it must be taken
from an iteration step very close to the solution, without any convergence
helpers, and with a precise FFT algorithm (e.g. the multi-dimensional FFT).

\addvspace{12pt}

Finally, the noise voltages from the interconnecting ports have to be used
to compute all other noise voltages. This is straight forward:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Convert the noise-voltage correlation matrix into the noise-current
   correlation matrix.
\item Expand the matrix to the whole circuit, i.e. fill it up with zeros.
\item Perform an AC noise analysis for all nodes of interest.
\end{enumerate}

The whole algorithm has to be performed for every noise frequency
$\omega_R$ of interest.


\section{Phase and Amplitude Noise}

The harmonic balance noise analysis calculates the noise power spectral
density $S_{uu,k}(\omega_R)$ at the noise frequency $\omega_R$ of the
$k$-th harmonic. The SSB phase and amplitude noise normalized to the
carrier can be obtained by using the symmetry between positive and
negative harmonic numbers:
\begin{equation}
\left< \Phi_k \Phi_{-k}^* \right> =
 \dfrac{S_{uu,k} + S_{uu,-k} - 2\cdot \text{Re}\left( C_{Z,k,-k}\cdot\exp(-j\cdot 2\cdot\phi_k) \right)}
       {| U_k |^2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\left< A_k A_{-k}^* \right> =
 \dfrac{S_{uu,k} + S_{uu,-k} + 2\cdot \text{Re}\left( C_{Z,k,-k}\cdot\exp(-j\cdot 2\cdot\phi_k) \right)}
       {| U_k |^2}
\end{equation}
with $U_k = |U_k| \cdot \exp(j\cdot\phi_k)$ being the $k$-th harmonic.
