$NOLATEX = 0;           # 1 = do not pass unknown environments to Latex

$EXTERNAL_IMAGES = 0;   # 1 = leave the images outside the document

# images.

$DESTDIR = '';         # Put the result in this directory

$NO_NAVIGATION = 0;	# 1 = do not put a navigation panel at the top of each page

# then match those that would have bee produced by LaTeX.
# The correct section numbers are obtained from the $FILE.aux file generated

### Other global variables ###############################################

# want some generated section titles (eg "Table of Contents" or "References")

### Navigation Panel ##########################################################
#
# The navigation panel is constructed out of buttons and section titles.
# These can be configured in any combination with arbitrary text and 
# HTML tags interspersed between them. 
# The buttons available are:
# $PREVIOUS - points to the previous section
# $UP  - points up to the "parent" section
# $NEXT - points to the next section
# $NEXT_GROUP - points to the next "group" section
# $PREVIOUS_GROUP - points to the previous "group" section
# $CONTENTS - points to the contents page if there is one
# $INDEX - points to the index page if there is one
#
# If the corresponding section exists the button will contain an
# active link to that section. If the corresponding section does
# not exist the button will be inactive.
#
# Also for each of the $PREVIOUS $UP $NEXT $NEXT_GROUP and $PREVIOUS_GROUP
# buttons there are equivalent $PREVIOUS_TITLE, $UP_TITLE, etc variables
# which contain the titles of their corresponding sections. 
# Each title is empty if there is no corresponding section.
#
# The subroutine below constructs the navigation panels in each page.
# Feel free to mix and match buttons, titles, your own text, your logos,
# and arbitrary HTML (the "." is the Perl concatenation operator).

#    "$NEXT $UP $PREVIOUS $CONTENTS $INDEX $CUSTOM_BUTTONS" .
