\tutsection{Introduction}

Operation amplifiers (OP AMP) are a fundamental building block of linear electronics.  They have been widely employed in linear circuit design since they were first introduced over thirty years ago. The use of operational amplifier models for circuit simulation using SPICE and other popular circuit simulators is widespread, and many manufacturers provide models for their devices. In most cases, these models do not attempt to simulate the internal circuitry at device level, but use macromodelling to represent amplifier behaviour as observed at the terminals of a device.  The purpose of this tutorial note is to explain how macromodels can be used to simulate a range of the operational amplifier properties and to show how macromodel parameters can be obtained from manufacturers data sheets.  This tutorial concentrates on models that can be simulated using Qucs release 0.0.9.




\tutsection{The Qucs built-in operational amplifier model}

Qucs includes a model for an ideal operational amplifier. It's symbol can be found in the nonlinear components list. This model represents an operational amplifier as an ideal device with differential gain and output voltage limiting. The model is intended for use as a simple gain block and should not be used in circuit simulations where operational amplifier properties are crucial to overall circuit performance. Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp1} shows a basic inverting amplifier with a gain of ten, based on the Qucs OP AMP model. The simulated AC performance of this circuit is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp2}.  From Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp2} it is observed that the circuit gain and phase shift are constant and do not change as the frequency of the input signal is increased. This, of course, is an ideal situation which practical operational amplifiers do not reproduce.  Let us compare the performance of the same circuit with the operational amplifier represented by a device level circuit. Shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp3} is a transistor circuit diagram for the well known UA741 operational amplifier\footnote{The UA741 operational amplifier is one of the most studied devices. It is almost unique in that a transistor level model has been constructed for the device. Details of the circuit operation and modelling of this device can be found in (1) Paul R. Grey et. al., Analysis and Design of Analog Integrated Circuits, Fourth Edition, 2001, John Wiley and Sons INC., ISBN 0-471-32168-0, and (2) Andrei Vladimirescu, The SPICE book, 1994, John Wiley and Sons, ISBN 0-471-60926-9.}. The gain and phase results for the circuit shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp1}, where the OP AMP is modelled by the UA741 transistor level model, are given in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp4}.  The curves in this figure clearly illustrate the differences between the two simulation models.  When simulating circuits that include operational amplifiers the quality of the OP AMP model can often be a limiting factor in the accuracy of the overall simulation results.  Accurate OP AMP models normally include a range of the following device characteristics: (1) DC and AC differential gain, (2) input bias current, (3) input current and voltage offsets, (4) input impedance, (5) common mode effects, (6) slew rate effects, (7) output impedance, (8) power supply rejection effects, (9) noise, (10) output voltage limiting, (11) output  current limiting and (12) signal overload recovery effects. The exact mix of selected properties largely depends on the purpose for which the model is being used; for example, if a model is only required for small signal AC transfer function simulation then including the output voltage limiting section of an OP AMP model is not necessary or indeed may be considered inappropriate. In the following sections of this tutorial article macromodels for a number of the OP AMP parameters listed above are developed and in each case the necessary techniques are outlined showing how to derive macromodel parameters from manufacturers data sheets.

\tutsection{Adding features to the Qucs OP AMP model}

In the previous section it was shown that the Qucs OP AMP model had a frequency response that is independent of frequency.  By adding external components to the Qucs OP AMP model the functionality of the model can be improved.  The UA741 differential open loop gain has a pole at roughly 5Hz and a frequency response that decreases at 20 dB per frequency decade from the first pole frequency up to a second pole frequency at roughly 3 MHz. The circuit shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp5} models the differential frequency characteristics of a UA741 from DC to around 1 MHz. Figure ~\ref{fig:opamp6} illustrates the closed loop frequency response for the modified Qucs OP AMP model.



\tutsection{Modular operational amplifier macromodels}

Macromodelling is a term given to the process of modelling an electronic device as a "black box" where individual device characteristics are specified in terms of the signals, and other properties, observed at the input and output terminals of the black box.  Such models operate at a functional level rather than at the more detailed transistor circuit level, offering considerable gain in computational efficiency.\footnote{  Computational efficiency is increased mainly due to the fact that operational amplifier macromodels have, on average, about one sixth of the number of nodes and branches when compared to a transistor level model.  Furthermore, the number of non-linear p-n junctions included in  a macromodel is often less than ten which compares favorable with the forty to fifty needed to model an amplifier at transistor level.}  Macromodels are normally derived directly from manufacturers data sheets.  For the majority of operational amplifiers, transistor level models are not normally provided by manufacturers.  One notable exception being the UA741 operational amplifier shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp3}.\\
A block diagram of a modular\footnote{Brinson M. E. and Faulkner D. J., Modular SPICE macromodel for operational amplifiers, IEE Proc.-Circuits Devices Syst., Vol. 141, No. 5, October 1994, pp. 417-420.} general purpose OP AMP macromodel is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp7}.  In this diagram the blocks represent specific amplifier characteristics modelled by electrical networks composed of components found in all the popular circuit simulators\footnote{Models employing non-linear controlled sources, for example the SPICE B voltage and current sources, are not allowed in Qucs release 0.0.9. Non-linear controlled sources are one of the features on the Qucs to-do list.}. Each block consists of one or more components which model a single amplifier parameter or a group of related parameters such as the input offset current and voltage.  This ensures that changes to one particular parameter do not indirectly change other parameters.  Local nodes and scaling are also employed in the macromodel blocks.  Furthermore, because each block operates separately, scaled voltages do not propagate outside individual blocks. Each block can be modelled with a Qucs subcircuit that has the required specification and buffering from other blocks.  Moreover, all subcircuits are self contained entities where the internal circuit details are hidden from other blocks.  Such an approach is similar to structured high-level computer programming where the internal details of functions are hidden from users.   Since the device characteristics specified by each block are separate from all other device characteristics only those amplifier characteristics which are needed are included in a given macromodel. This approach leads to a genuinely structured macromodel.  The following sections present the detail and derivation of the electrical networks forming the blocks drawn in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp7}. To illustrate the operation of the modular OP AMP macromodel the values of the block parameters are calculated for the UA741 OP AMP and used in a series of example simulations.  Towards the end of this tutorial note data are presented for a number of other popular general purpose operational amplifiers.
\tutsection{A basic AC OP AMP macromodel. }

A minimum set of blocks is required for the modular macromodel to function as an amplifier: an input stage, a gain stage and an output stage.  These form the core modules of all macromodels.  

\tutsubsection{The input stage.}
The input stage includes amplifier offset voltage, bias and offset currents, and the differential input impedance components. The circuit for the input stage is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp8}, where
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{R1   = R2} = Half of the amplifier differential input resistance (\textit{RD}).
\item \textit{Cin}   = The amplifier differential input capacitance (\textit{CD}).
\item \textit{Ib1    = Ib2} = The amplifier input bias current (\textit{IB}).
\item \textit{Ioff}  = Half the amplifier input offset current (\textit{IOFF}).
\item \textit{Voff1 = Voff2} = Half the input offset voltage ( \textit{VOFF}).
\end{enumerate}

Typical values for the UA741 OP AMP are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{RD} = 2 M$\Omega$ and \textit{R1 = R2} = 1M$\Omega$
\item \textit{CD} = \textit{Cin1} = 1.4 pF.
\item \textit{IB} = \textit{Ib1} = \textit{Ib2 }= 80 nA.
\item \textit{IOFF} = 20 nA and \textit{Ioff1} = 10 nA.
\item \textit{VOFF} = 0.7 mV and \textit{Voff1 = Voff2} = 0.35 mV.
\end{enumerate}

\tutsubsection{Voltage gain stage 1.}
The circuit for voltage gain stage 1 is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp9}, where
\begin{enumerate}
\item\textit{ RD1} = 100 M$\Omega$ = A dummy input resistor - added to ensure nodes $IN_{-}P1$ and $IN_{-}N1$ are connected by a DC path.
\item \textit{GMP1} = 1 S = Unity gain voltage controlled current generator.
\item \textit{RADO }= The DC open loop differential gain ( \textit{AOL(DC)} ) of the OP AMP.
\item \textit{CP1}  = \textit{1/(2*$\pi$*GBP)}, where \textit{GBP} = the OP AMP gain bandwidth product.
\end{enumerate}

Typical values for the UA741 OP AMP are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{RADO} =  200k$\Omega$. ($AOL(DC)$ = 106 dB)
\item \textit{CP1}  =  159.15 nF  (The typical value for UA741 GBP is 1 MHz).
\end{enumerate}

\tutsubsection{Derivation of voltage gain stage 1 transfer function}

Most general purpose operational amplifiers have an open loop differential voltage gain which has (1) a very high value at DC (2) a dominant pole (\textit{fp1}) at a low frequency - typically below 100 Hz, and (3) a gain response characteristic that rolls-off at 20 dB per decade up to a unity gain frequency which is often in the MHz region.  This form of response has a constant gain bandwidth product (\textit{GBP}) over the frequency range from \textit{fp1} to \textit{GBP}.  A typical OP AMP differential open loop response is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp10}. The voltage gain transfer function for this type of characteristic can be modelled with the electrical network given in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp9}, where the the AC voltage transfer function is


\begin{equation}
vout(POLE_{-}1_{-}OUT1) = \dfrac{ GMP1 * ( V( IN _{-} P1 ) - V(IN _{-} N1) ) * RADO} { 1 + j (\omega * RADO * CP1 ) }
\end{equation}
Where \begin{equation}
        f_{P1} = \dfrac {1} {2\pi * RADO * CP1}
      \end{equation}
Let \textit{RADC = Aol(DC)} and \textit{GMP1 = 1 S}. Then, because \textit{fp1*AOL(DC) = GBP},
\begin{equation} 
CP1 = \dfrac{1} { 2\pi*GBP}
\end{equation}

\tutsubsection{Output stage.}
The electrical network representing a basic output stage is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp11}, where

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{ RD1}     = 100 M$\Omega$ = A dummy input resistor - added to ensure nodes $IN_{-}P1$ and $IN_{-}N1$ are connected by a DC path.
\item \textit{EOS1}   G = 1 = Unity gain voltage controlled voltage generator.
\item \textit{ROS1}     =  OP AMP output resistance.
\end{enumerate}

A typical value for the UA741 OP AMP output resistance is \textit{ROS1} =  75$\Omega$.

\end{figure}

\tutsubsection{A subcircuit model for the basic AC OP AMP macromodel}
The model for the basic AC OP AMP macromodel is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp12}. The input stage common mode voltage ($Vcm$) is not used in this macromodel and has been left floating.  To test the performance of the AC macromodel it's operation was compared to the transistor level UA741 model. Figure ~\ref{fig:opamp13} shows a schematic circuit for two inverting amplifiers, each with a gain of ten, driven from a common AC source. One of the amplifiers uses the simple AC macromodel and the other the transistor level UA741 model.  Figure ~\ref{fig:opamp14} illustrates the output gain and phase curves for both amplifiers. In general the plotted curves are very similar.  However, at frequencies above the GBP frequency the basic AC macromodel does not correctly model actual OP AMP performance. This is to be expected because the simple AC macromodel does not include any high frequency modelling components.  Notice also that the DC output voltages for vout and vout3 are very similar, see the DC tabular results given in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp13}.

\tutsection{ A more accurate OP AMP AC macromodel}

Most general purpose OP AMPs have a high frequency pole in their differential open loop gain characteristics.  By adding a second gain stage to the simple AC macromodel the discrepancy in the high frequency response can be corrected.  The model for the second gain stage is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp15}.  This additional gain stage has a structure similar to the first gain stage, where

\begin{enumerate}
\item\textit{RD2} = 100 M$\Omega$ = A dummy input resistor - added to ensure nodes \verb|IN_P2| and \verb|IN_N2| are connected by a DC path.
\item \textit{GMP2} = 1 S = Unity gain voltage controlled current generator.
\item \textit{RP2 } = 1$\Omega$.
\item \textit{CP2}  = \textit{1/(2$\pi$*fp2)}, where $fp2$ = the second pole frequency in Hz.
\end{enumerate}

A typical value for the UA741 OP AMP high frequency pole is  \textit{fp2}  =  3M Hz

  \caption{Modular OP AMP second voltage gain stage.}

\end{figure}

\tutsubsection{Derivation of voltage gain stage 2 transfer function.}
The differential voltage gain transfer function for voltage gain stage 2 is given by

\begin{equation}
vout(POLE_{-}2_{-}OUT1) = \dfrac{ GMP2 * ( V( IN _{-} P2 ) - V(IN _{-} N2) ) * RP2} { 1 + j (\omega * RP2 * CP2 ) }
\end{equation}

Let \textit{RP2 = 1$\Omega$} and \textit{GMP2 = 1 S}. Then 

\begin{equation}
vout(POLE_{-}2_{-}OUT1) = \dfrac{ V( IN _{-} P2 ) - V(IN _{-} N2)} { 1 + j (\omega *  CP2 ) }
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation} 
CP2 = \dfrac{1} { 2\pi*fp2}
\end{equation}

\newpage
\tutsubsection{Simulating OP AMP open loop differential gain}

The circuit shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp16} allows the open loop differential gain \textit{(Aol(f))} to be simulated. This circuit employes a feedback resistor to ensure DC stability.  Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp16} illustrates two test circuits driven from a common AC source. This allows the performance of the AC macromodel and the UA741 transistor level model to be compared. The AC voltage transfer function for the test circuit is
  
\begin{equation}
vout(f) = \dfrac{ Aol(f)} { 1 +  \dfrac{ Aol(f) }{1 + j \omega * R * C} } vin(f)
\end{equation} 

where $vout(f) = (V^{+} - V^{-})*Aol(f)$,  $V^{+} = vin(f)$, and $V^{-} = \dfrac{vout(f)}{1 + j \omega * R * C} $

Provided $\dfrac{Aol(f)}{\omega*R*C} << 1$, equation (7) becomes $vout(f) \Rightarrow Aol(f) * vin(f)$. Hence, for those frequencies where this condition applies \textit{vout(f) = Aol(f)} when\textit{ vin(f)} = 1 V.  Figure 17 shows plots of the open loop simulation data. Clearly with the test circuit time constant set at 1e6 seconds the data is accurate for frequencies down to 1 Hz.

\tutsection{Adding common mode effects to the OP AMP AC macromodel}

The open-loop differential gain $A_{D}(f)$ for most general purpose operational amplifiers can be approximated by

\begin{equation}
A_{D}(f)=AD(0)\dfrac{1}{1+j\dfrac{f}{f_{PD}}}
\end{equation}

Similarly, the common-mode gain $A_{CM}(f)$ can be represented by the same single-pole response and a single zero response given by
\begin{equation}
A_{CM}(f)=A_{CM}(0)\dfrac{1+j\dfrac{f}{f_{CMZ}}}{1+j\dfrac{f}{f_{PD}}}
\end{equation}
Defining the common-mode rejection ratio $CMRR(f)$ of an OP AMP as
\begin{equation}
CMRR(f)=\dfrac{A_{D}(f)}{A_{CM}(f)}
\end{equation}

gives
\begin{equation}
CMRR(f)=CMRR(0)\dfrac{1}{1+j\dfrac{f}{f_{CMZ}}}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
CMRR(0)=\dfrac{A_{D}(0)}{A_{CM}(0)}
\end{equation}

Common-mode effects can be added to OP AMP macromodels by including a stage in the modular macromodel that introduces a zero in the amplifier frequency response.  Output $V_{CM}$ from the macromodel input stage senses an amplifier common mode signal.  This signal, when passed through a CR network generates the required common mode zero. Figure 18 gives the model of the zero generating network, where.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{RDCMZ} = 650 M$\Omega$ = common-mode input resistance/2.
\item \textit{RCM1 } = 1 M$\Omega$
\item \textit{ECM1}    G = 31.623 = $\dfrac{\dfrac{RCM1}{RCM2}}{CMRR(0)}$. (NOTE: \textit{RCM1/RCM2}is a scaling factor.)
\item \textit{CCM1}  = 795.8 pF = $\dfrac{1}{2\pi*RCM1*f_{CMZ}}$.
\item \textit{RCM2 } = 1 $\Omega$
\end{enumerate}
Typical values for the UA741 OP AMP are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Common-mode input resistance = 1300 M$\Omega$.
\item \textit{CMRR(0)} =  90 dB 
\item \textit{$f_{CMZ}$} =  200 Hz.
\end{enumerate}


\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{fig18a_sch}
% tcomb1.png: 99.9998dpi, width=11.35cm, height=3.35cm, bb=0 0 447 132
  \caption{Common-mode zero macromodel}
  \label{fig:opamp18a}
\end{figure}

The AC voltage transfer function for the common-mode zero transfer function is

\begin{equation}
Vout(\verb|CMV_OUT1|)=G(ECM1)\dfrac{RCM2}{RCM1}\left[  \dfrac{1+j\omega*RCM1*CCM1}{1+j\omega*RCM2*CCM1}\right] \left[ V(\verb|IN_P1|)-V(\verb|IN_N1|)\right] 
\end{equation}

As $\dfrac{RCM2}{RCM1} << 1$, the pole introduced by the common-mode RC network is at a very high frequency and can be neglected. Combining the common-mode zero with the previously defined stage models yields the macromodel shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp18b}.  In this model the differential and common-mode signals are combined using a simple analogue adder based on voltage conrolled current generators.

  \caption{AC macromodel including common-mode zero.}
  \label{fig:opamp18b}
\end{figure}

\tutsubsection{Simulating OP AMP common-mode effects}
OP AMP common-mode effects can be simulated using the circuit shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp20}.\footnote{Brinson M.E. and Faulkner D.J., New approaches to measurement of operational amplifier common-mode rejection ratio in the frequency domain, IEE Proc-Circuits Devices Sys., Vol 142, NO. 4, August 1995, pp 247-253.} The resulting output voltages (vout.v and vout3.v) for a test circuit with matched resistors are shown plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp21}, where
$\dfrac{vout(0)}{vin}=\dfrac{1}{CMRR(0)}$.  Clearly the test results for the macromodel and the UA741 transistor model are very similar.  In the case of the macromodel typical device parameters were used to calculate the macromodel component values.  However, in the transistor level model the exact values of the component parameters are unknown.\footnote{The UA741 transistor level model is based on an estimate of the process parameters that determine the UA741 transistor characteristics.  Hence, the device level model is unlikely to be absolutely identical to the model derived from typical parameters values found on OP AMP data sheets. From the simulation results the CMRR(0) values are approximately (1) macromodel 90 dB, (2) UA741 transistor model 101 dB. Similarly, the common-mode zero frequencies are approximately (1) macromodel 200 Hz, (2) UA741 transistor model 500 Hz.}

\tutsection{Large signal transient domain OP AMP macromodels}

The modular macromodel introduced in the previous sections concentrated on modelling OP AMP performance in the small signal AC domain. Large signal models need to take into account the passage of signals through an OP AMP in the time domain and limit the excursion of voltage and current swings to the practical values found in actual amplifiers. Starting with the AC domain macromodel introduced in the previous sections, adding a slew rate limiting stage and a overdrive stage will more correctly model OP AMP high speed large signal limitations. Furthermore, by adding output voltage and current limiting stages the OP AMP macromodel will correctly model large signal effects when signal levels approach circuit power supply voltages or the OP AMP output current limits. 

\tutsubsection{Slew rate macromodel derivation}

The slew rate of an OP AMP can be modelled by limiting the current charging $CP1$ in the first voltage gain stage POLE1. From Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp9}

\begin{equation}
GMP1 \left(  V(IN_{-}P1) - V(IN_{-}N1) \right)  = \dfrac{ V( POLE_{-}1_{-}OUT1 ) } {RADO}+CP1*\dfrac{ dV(POLE_{-}1_{-}OUT1) } {dt} 
\end{equation}

Hence, provided $RADO$ is large\footnote{This condition is normally true because $RADO$ is set to the DC open loop differential gain in macromodule POLE1. }

\begin{equation}
GMP1 \left(  V( IN_{-}P1 ) - V( IN_{-}N1 ) \right)  \simeq  CP1*\dfrac{ dV(POLE_{-}1_{-}OUT1) } {dt}  
\end{equation}


But $ CP1 = \dfrac{1}{2\pi*GBP}$ 


Yielding

\begin{equation}
GMP1 \left(  V(IN_{-}P1) - V(IN_{-}N1) \right)  \simeq \dfrac{1}{2\pi*GBP}*\dfrac{ dV(POLE_{-}1_{-}OUT1) } {dt}  
\end{equation}

Moreover, if $\dfrac{ dV(POLE_{-}1_{-}OUT1)}{dt}$ is set equal to the OP-AMP slew rate then the current\\
 
charging \textit{CP1} will be limited to the maximum allowed. In Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp9} $GMP1$ is 1 S. \\

Therefore, voltage difference  $ V(IN_{-}P1) - V(IN_{-}N1)$\\

must be set to $\dfrac{1}{2\pi*GBP}*\dfrac{ dV(POLE_{-}1_{-}OUT1) } {dt}$.\\

This is done by the network SLEWRT shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp22}, where

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{RSCALE1}  = 100 $\Omega$ = Scaling resistance (Scale factor x 100).
\item \textit{SRC1}   G = 1 S.
\item \textit{VSR1}    = V1.
\item \textit{GMSRT1}  G = 0.01 S. (Scale factor = 1/100).
\item \textit{RSRT1}    = 1 $\Omega$
\end{enumerate}
And, 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $V1 = \dfrac{100 * Positive_{-}slew_{-}rate}{2\pi*GBP}-0.7V$
\item $V2 = \dfrac{100 * Negative_{-}slew_{-}rate}{2\pi*GBP}-0.7V$
\item The diode parameters are IS=1e-12 IBV=20mA BV=V1+V2, others default.
\end{enumerate}

Typical values for the UA741 OP AMP are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $Positive_{-}slew_{-}rate$ = $Negative_{-}slew_{-}rate$ = 0.5V/$\mu$S.
\item $V1$ = $V2$ = 7.25V.
\end{enumerate}

Scaling is used in the slew rate model to allow the use of higher voltages in the clamping circuit. Increased voltages reduce errors due to the forward biased junction voltage. Current limiting results by clamping the voltage across resistor $RSCALE1$ with a diode. This diode acts as a zener diode and saves one nonlinear junction when compared to conventional clamping circuits.  The output section of the SLEWRT circuit removes the internal scaling yielding an overall gain of unity for the module.\\


The circuit in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp23} demonstrates the effect of slew rate limiting on OP AMP transient performance. Three identical OP AMP inverter circuits are driven from a common input 10 kHz AC signal source. Voltage controlled voltage sources are used to amplify the input signal to the second and third circuits.  The three input signals are (1) 5 V peak, (2) 10 V peak and (3) 15 V peak respectively.  The input and output waveforms for this circuit are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp24}. The effect of slew rate limiting on large signal transient performance is clearly demonstrated by these curves. In the case of the 15 V peak input signal the output signal (vout3.Vt) has a slope that is roughly 0.5 V per $\mu$S.

\tutsubsection{Modelling OP AMP overdrive and output voltage limiting}

Large transient signals can overdrive an OP AMP causing it's output voltage to saturate. On removal of the overdrive signal an OP AMP takes a finite time to recover\footnote{Overload recovery time of an OP AMP is the time required for the output voltage to recover to a rated output voltage from a saturated condition. Typical values are in the $\mu$ S region.} and return to normal linear circuit behaviour.  When saturated the output voltage is clamped at a voltage close to the plus or minus power rail voltage.  The overdrive and voltage clamping properties of an OP AMP are related and macromodels for both effects need to be added to an OP AMP model when simulating OP AMP overdrive characteristics.  However, in many circuit simulations the overdrive macromodel can be left out without loss of functionality or accuracy.\\

The effect of overdrive signals can be modelled by a voltage clamping circuit which takes account of OP AMP recovery time from voltage overdrive. This extra element clamps the output of the POLE1 module at a level above the OP AMP DC supply voltages. The overall effect of the overdrive circuit is to delay the restoration of linear circuit behaviour when an overload signal is removed.  In contrast to the overdrive module the output voltage limiting module clamps the output voltage to a voltage close to the power rail voltages, clipping any output voltage excursions above the power rail voltage levels. Figure ~\ref{fig:opamp25} illustrates the macromodels for the overdrive and output voltage limiting models, where

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{fig25_sch}

\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{VOVDR1} = 2.5 V = (Positive slew rate)*(Amplifier recovery time).
\item \textit{VOVDR2} = 2.5 V = (Negative slew rate)*(Amplifier recovery time).
\item \textit{VLIM1}  = 2.0 V = (+ supply voltage) - (Maximum positive output voltage) + 1 V.
\item \textit{VLIM2}  = 2.0 V = (- supply voltage) - (Maximum negative output voltage) + 1 V.
\item The diode parameters are Is = 8e-16 A, others default.
\end{enumerate}

Typical values for the UA741 OP AMP are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Amplifier recovery time 5 $\mu$S.
\item + supply voltage =  15 V.
\item - supply voltage = -15 V.
\item Maximum positive output voltage =  14 V.
\item Maximum negative output voltage = -14 V.
\end{enumerate}

The test circuit given in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp26} illustrates the effects of signal overdrive and output voltage clamping on a unity gain buffer circuit. The test input signal is a 1 kHz signal with the following drive voltages (1) vin1 = 10 V peak, (2) vin2 = 18 V peak, and (3) vin3 = 22 V peak. The corresponding output waveforms are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp27}. These indicate that increasing overdrive signals results in longer OP AMP recovery times before the amplifier returns to linear behaviour.

\tutsubsection{Modelling OP AMP output current limiting}

Most general purpose OP AMPs have a network at the circuit output to protect the device from high load currents generated by shorting the output terminal to ground or some other situation where a high current flows through the OP AMP output stage. The electrical network shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp28} acts as a current limiter: current flowing between pins \verb|P_IN1| and\verb| P_OUT1| is sensed by current controlled voltage generator HCL1. The voltage output from generator HCL1 is in series with voltage controlled generator ECL1. The connection of these generators is in opposite polarity. Hence, when the load current reaches the maximum allowed by the OP AMP either diode DCL1 or DCL2 turns on clamping the OP AMP output voltage preventing the output current from increasing.  The parameters for the current limiter macromodel are given by

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{RDCL1} = 100 M$\Omega$ = Dummy resistor.
\item \textit{ECL1}   G = 1.
\item \textit{HCL1}   G = 36$\Omega$ = 0.9 V/(Maximum output current A).
\item The diode parameters are Is = 1e-15 A, others default.
\end{enumerate}
 
A typical value for the UA741 OP AMP short circuit current is 34 mA at $25^{o}$C.\\

 Figures~\ref{fig:opamp29} and~\ref{fig:opamp30} show a simple current limiter test circuit and the resulting test waveforms.  
 In this test circuit time controlled switches decrease the load resistors at 1 mS intervals. When the load current reaches
 roughly 34 mA the output voltage is clamped preventing further increases in load current.

\tutsection{Obtaining OP AMP macromodel parameters from published device data}
The OP AMP modular macromodel has one very distinct advantage when compared to other amplifier models namely that it is possible to derive the macromodel parameters directly from a common set characteristics found on the majority of manufacturer's data sheets. The data given in Table.~\ref{tab:tab1} shows a typical range of values found on OP AMP data sheets.  In cases where a particular parameter is not given then a starting point is to use a value obtained from a data sheet of an equivalent device. The macromodel element values are then calculated using the equations presented in the previous sections of this tutorial.  As a rule of thumb it is good practice to test each block in the modular macromodel prior to constructing a complete OP AMP macromodel.


\tutsection{More complete design examples.}

In this section two larger design examples are presented. These demonstrate the characteristics of the various OP AMP macromodels introduced in the previous text and attempt to give readers guidance as to the correct model to choose for a particular simulation.

\tutsubsection{Example 1: State variable filter design and simulation} 

The circuit given in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp31} is a state variable filter which simultaneously generates band-pass, high-pass and low-pass responses. The circuit consists of an OP AMP adder and two integrator circuits and requires three OP AMPS, two capacitors and a number of resistors.  The selection of the type of OP AMP for successful operation of this filter is critical because devices with high offset voltage will cause the integrators to saturate and the circuit will not function correctly. For operation below 20 kHz the OP27 is a good choice of OP AMP because of it's low offset voltage in the $\mu$V region. In this simulation both the DC characteristics and small signal AC transfer characteristics are needed to check the filter design, hence the AC macromodel with the DC parameters embedded in the input stage should allow accurate modelling of the filter performance.\footnote{The magnitude of the output signals from the filter should also be checked to ensure that these signals do not exceed the power supply voltages.}  The insert in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp31} list the DC output voltages for each of the OP AMP stages indicating that the integrators are not saturated.  The design of the state variable filter uses the following equations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The superposition principle yields
\begin{equation}
vhp = -\dfrac{R1}{R6}vin-\dfrac{R1}{R7}vlp+\left( 1+\dfrac{R1}{R7 \parallel R6} \right) \dfrac{R4}{R4+R5}vbp
\end{equation}
When $R1= R6 =R7$

\begin{equation}
vhp = -vin -vlp +  \dfrac{3R4}{R4+R5}vbp
\end{equation}

\item Also
\begin{equation}
vbp = -\dfrac{1}{j\frac{f}{f_{0}}}vhp
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
f_{0}=\dfrac{1}{2 \pi R_{2}C_{1}} = \dfrac{1}{2 \pi R_{3}C_{2}}
\end{equation} 

\item Similarly
\begin{equation}
vlp = -\dfrac{1}{j\frac{f}{f_{0}}}vbp = -\dfrac{1}{(\frac{f}{f_{0}})^{2}}vhp  
\end{equation}

\item Hence
\begin{equation}
\dfrac{vhp}{vin}=\dfrac{(\frac{f}{f_{0}})^{2}}{1-(\frac{f}{f_{0}})^{2}+(\frac{j}{Q})(\frac{f}{f_{0}})}
\end{equation}
Where
\begin{equation}
Q = \dfrac{1}{3}(1+\dfrac{R5}{R4})
\end{equation}

\item Also
\begin{equation}
\dfrac{vbp}{vin}=\dfrac{j\frac{f}{f_{0}}}{1-(\frac{f}{f_{0}})^{2}+(\frac{j}{Q})(\frac{f}{f_{0}})}
\end{equation}

\item Also
\begin{equation}
\dfrac{vlp}{vin}=\dfrac{-1}{1-(\frac{f}{f_{0}})^{2}+(\frac{j}{Q})(\frac{f}{f_{0}})}
\end{equation}

\end{enumerate}

Assuming $f_{0}$ = 1 kHz and the required bandwidth of the band pass filter is 10 Hz, on setting $R1 = R6 = R7 = 47 k\Omega$ and $C1 = C2 = 2.2 nF$, calculation yields $R2 = R3 = 72.33 k\Omega$\footnote{The values of $R2$ and $R3$ need to be trimmed if the filter center frequency and bandwidth are required to high accuracy.}  In this design $Q = 1k/10 = 100$.  Hence setting $R4 = 1k\Omega$ yields $R5 = 294k\Omega$ (1 \verb|%| tolerance). The simulation waveforms for the band pass output are given in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp32} \footnote{Note that the input signal $vin$ has been set at 0.1 V peak.  The circuit has a Q factor of 100 which means that the band pass output voltage is 10 V peak. Input signals of amplitude much greater than 0.1 V are likely to drive the output signal into saturation when the power supply voltages are $\pm15 V$.}.  When the circuit Q factor is reduced to lower values the other filter outputs act as traditional high and low pass filters. The simulation results for Q factor one are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp33}.

\tutsubsection{Example 2: Sinusoidal signal generation with the Wien bridge oscillator} 

The Wien bridge sinusoidal oscillator has become a classic due to it's simplicity and low distortion capabilities.  It is an ideal vehicle for demonstrating the properties of OP AMP macromodels and indeed the performance of circuit simulators. Shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp35} is the basic Wien bridge oscillator which consists of a single OP AMP with negative and positive feedback circuits. The design equations for this circuit are

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Non-inverting amplifier.
\begin{equation}
\dfrac{vout}{v+} = 1 + \dfrac{R3}{R4}
\end{equation}

\item Feedback factor
\begin{equation}
b = \dfrac{vout}{v+} =\dfrac{1}{3+j(\frac{f}{f_{0}}-\frac{f_{0}}{f})}
\end{equation}
Where $f_{0} = \dfrac{1}{2\pi R1 C1} =\dfrac{1}{2\pi R2 C2} $

\item Loop gain

The oscillator loop gain $b A_{v}$ must equal one for stable oscillations. Hence,
\begin{equation}
b A_{v} = \dfrac{1+\frac{R3}{R4}}{3+j(\frac{f}{f_{0}}-\frac{f_{0}}{f})}
\end{equation}

Moreover, at $f = f_{0}$,  
\begin{equation}
b A_{v} = \dfrac{1+\frac{R3}{R4}}{3}
\end{equation}

Setting $R3/R4$ slightly greater than two causes oscillations to start and increase in amplitude during each oscillatory cycle. Furthermore, if $R3/R4$ is less than two oscillations will never start or decrease to zero.
\end{enumerate}

Figure~\ref{fig:opamp36} shows a set of Wien bridge oscillator waveforms. In this example the OP AMP is modelled using the OP27 AC macromodel. This has been done deliberately to demonstrate what happens with a poor choice of OP AMP model.  The oscillator frequency is 10 kHz with both feedback capacitors and resistors having equal values. Notice that the oscillatory output voltage continues to grow with increasing time until it's value far exceeds the limit set by a practical OP AMP power supply voltages.  The lower of the two curves in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp36} illustrates the frequency spectrum of the oscillator output signal. The data for this curve has been generated using the Time2Freq function.  Adding slew rate and voltage limiting to the OP27 macromodel will limit the oscillator output voltage excursions to the OP AMP power supply values. The waveforms for this simulation are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp37}.  When analysing transient response data using function Time2Freq it is advisable to restrict the analysis to regions of the response where the output waveform has reached a steady state otherwise the frequency spectrum will include effects due to growing, or decreasing, transients.  The voltage limiting network clips the oscillator output voltage restricting its excursions to below the OP AMP power supply voltages.  The clipping is very visible in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp37}.  Notice also that the output waveform is distorted and is no longer a pure sinusoidal waveform of 10 kHz frequency.  Odd harmonics are clearly visible and the fundamental frequency has also decreased due to the signal saturation distortion.  In a practical Wien bridge oscillator the output waveform should be a pure sinusoid with zero or little harmonic distortion.  One way to achieve this is to change the amplitude of the OP AMP gain with changing signal level: as the output signal increases so $Av$ is decreased or as the output signal level decreases $Av$ is increased.  At all times the circuit parameters are changed to achieve the condition $b Av = 1$.  The circuit shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp38} uses two diodes and a resistor to automatically change the OP AMP closed loop gain with changing signal level.  Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp39} shows the corresponding waveforms for the Wien bridge circuit with automatic gain control.  Changing the value of resistor $R5$ causes the amplitude of the oscillator output voltage to stabilise at a different value; decreasing $R5$ also decreases $vout$. The automatic gain control version of the Wien bridge oscillator also reduces the amount of harmonic distortion generated by the oscillator.  This can be clearly observed in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp39}.  Changing the oscillator frequency can be accomplished by either changing the capacitor or resistor values in the feedback network $b$. To demonstrate how this can be done using Qucs, consider the circuit shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp40}.  In this circuit time controlled switches change the value of both capacitors as the simulation progresses.  The recorded output waveform for this circuit is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp41}.

In this first update to the operational amplifier tutorial readers will be introduced to Qucs macromodel model building using schematics and SPICE to Qucs conversion techniques, secondly to procedures for constructing  Qucs operational amplifier libraries, and finally to two different approaches which allow existing OP AMP models to be extended to include new amplifier performance parameters, for example power supply rejection. This update is very much a report on the OP AMP modelling work that has been done by the Qucs development team since version 0.0.10 of the package was released in September 2006.  Future Qucs releases will offer many significant improvements in OP AMP modelling particularly via SPICE to Qucs netlist conversion, subcircuit passing and equation embedding in Qucs schematics  and library development. Following the release of Qucs 0.0.11, and a suitable period of time for new feature debugging, many of the ideas introduced in this update will be developed to include OP AMP model building using embedded equations in Qucs schematics.

\tutsubsection{Building a library component for the modular OP AMP macromodel} 
One of the main strengths of the modular macromodel approach to device modelling is the fact that the parameters implicit in each section of a macromodel are essentially independent, allowing subcircuit blocks to be easily connected together to form an overall device model.  Taking this idea further one can construct a complete schematic for an OP AMP model from the circuitry that represents individual macromodel subcircuit blocks.  The diagram shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp42} illustrates a typical circuit schematic for a modular OP AMP macromodel.  In this schematic the component values are for the UA741 OP AMP.  By attaching a symbol to the modular macromodel schematic the UA741 modular OP AMP model is ready for general use and can be placed in an existing\footnote{Qucs 0.0.10, and earlier releases, were distributed with an OP AMP library called OpAmps. However, this only contained a component level model for the 741 OP AMP. Many of the models discussed in this text have been added to the Qucs OpAmps library. These should assist readers who wish to experiment with their own OP AMP circuits.} or a user defined library.  Moreover, by recalculating the component values further library elements can be constructed and the development of a more extensive Qucs OP AMP library undertaken\footnote{One of the important future tasks is the development of component libraries for use with Qucs - this will take time but should be possible given enough effort by everyone interested in Qucs.}.

\tutsubsection{Changing model parameters: use of the SPICEPP preprocessor}
Changing the component data in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp42} allows users to generate modular macromodels for different operational amplifiers.  Although this is a perfectly viable approach to model generation it is both tedious and error prone. A more straightforward way is to get the computer to do the tedious work involving component value calculation from device data. With this approach users are only required to enter the device data; as a simple list derived from manufacturers data sheets. One way to do this is to write a SPICE preprocessor template\footnote{The use of the SPICE preprocessors SPICEPP and SPICEPRM are described in Qucs tutorial \textit{Qucs simulation of SPICE netlists}.  Since both SPICEPP and SPICEPRM were first written, Friedrch Schmidt has developed a PSpice to SPICE3/XSPICE preprocessor which combines, and extends, the features found in both SPICEPP and SPICEPRM. This preprocessor is called PS2SP. The Perl script version of PS2SP is licensed under GPL and may be downloaded from http://members.aon.at/fschmid7/. } and let a SPICE preprocessor generate the model for a specific OP AMP. The PS2SP template file for an OP27 OP AMP modular macromodel is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp43}.  The resulting SPICE file is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp44}. After construction of the SPICE OP27 netlist the Qucs OP27 model is generated via the schematic capture SPICE netlist facility.\footnote{See the tutorial \textit{Qucs simulation of SPICE netlist} for instructions on how this can be done. }

\tutsubsection{The Boyle operational amplifier SPICE model}

The Boyle\footnote{G.R. Boyle, B.M. Cohn, D. Pederson, and J.E. Solomon, Macromodelling of integrated circuit operational amplifiers, IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits, vol. SC-9, pp. 353-364, 1974.} operational amplifier model was one of the earliest attempts at constructing an OP AMP macromodel that achieved significantly reduced simulation times, when compared to those times obtained with discrete transistor level models\footnote{See Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp3}. Tests show that the Boyle macromodel reduces simulation times for common amplifier, timer and filter circuits by a factor between six and ten.}, while maintaining acceptable functional properties and simulation accuracy. The Boyle macromodel was designed to model differential gain versus frequency, DC common-mode gain, device input and output characteristics, slew rate limiting, output voltage swing and short-circuit limiting.  The circuit schematic for the Boyle macromodel of a bipolar OP AMP  is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp45}. This model consists of three connected stages: the input stage, the intermediate voltage gain stage and the output stage. Calculation of individual component values is complex, relying on a set of equations derived from the physical properties of the semiconductor devices and the structure of the electrical network.  These equations are derived in the Boyle paper and summarised in the following list. Starting with $I_{S1} = $8.0e-16, the emitter base leakage current of transistor T1, and by assuming $R2 = 100k$ the model component values can be calculated using:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item $I_{S2} = I_{S1} \cdot exp\left(\frac{VOS}{Vt}\right)   \cong I_{S1}\left[ 1+\dfrac{VOS}{Vt}\right]$ ,where $Vt = $ 26e-3 V.
 \item $I_{C1} = \dfrac{C_{2} SR^{+}}{2}$, where $SR^{+}$ is the positive slew rate.
 \item $I_{C2} = I_{C1}$
 \item $I_{B1} = I_{B}-\dfrac{I_{OS}}{2}$ and $I_{B2} = I_{B} + \dfrac{I_{OS}}{2}$
 \item $B_{1} = \dfrac{I_{C1}}{I_{B1}}$ and $B_{2} = \dfrac{I_{C2}}{I_{B2}}$ 
 \item $IEE = \left[ \dfrac{B_{1}+1}{B_{1}} + \dfrac{B_{2}+1}{B_{2}}\right] I_{C1}$
 \item $RC1 = \dfrac{1}{2 \pi GBP C_{2}}$ 
 \item $RC2 = RC1$
 \item $RE1 = \dfrac{B_{1}+B_{2}}{2+B_{1}+B_{2}}\left[ RC1-\dfrac{1}{gm1}\right] $, where $gm1 = \dfrac{I_{C1}}{Vt}$, and $RE2 = RE1$
 \item $CEE = \dfrac{C2}{2} \cdot tan\left(  \triangle \phi \dfrac{\pi}{180}\right)$, where $\triangle \phi = 90^{o} - \Phi m$ and $\Phi m$ is the phase margin.
 \item $GCM = \dfrac{1}{CMMR RC1}$
 \item $GA = \dfrac{1}{RC1}$
 \item $GB = \dfrac{AvOL RC1}{R2 RO2}$
 \item $ISD1 = IX \cdot exp\left(TMP1\right) $+1e-32, where $IX = 2 \cdot I_{C1} \cdot R2 \cdot GB -I_{S1}$, \linebreak and $TMP1 = \dfrac{-1}{RO1\dfrac{I_{S1}}{Vt}}$
 \item $RC = \dfrac{Vt}{100 \cdot IX}ln\left( TEMP2\right) $, where $TEMP2 = \dfrac{IX}{ISD1}$
 \item $VC = abs\left( VCC\right) - VOUT_P + Vt \cdot ln\left( \dfrac{ISC_P}{I_{S1}}\right) $
 \item $VE = abs\left( VEE\right) + VOUT_N + VT \cdot ln\left( \dfrac{ISC_N}{I_{S1}}\right) $ 
 \item $RP = \dfrac{\left( VCC-VEE\right) \left( VCC-VEE\right) }{PD}$
\end{enumerate}

Rather than calculate the Boyle macromodel component values by hand using a calculator it is better to use a PS2SP preprocessor template that does these calculations and also generates the Boyle SPICE netlist. A template for this task is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp46}.  The parameters at the beginning of the listing are for the UA741 OP AMP. In Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp46} the macromodel internal nodes are indicated by numbers and external nodes by descriptive names. This makes it easier to attach the macromodel interface nodes to a Qucs schematic symbol.  The SPICE netlist shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp47} was generated by SP2SP.

\tutsubsection{Model accuracy}
The modular and Boyle OP AMP macromodels are examples of typical device models in common use with todays popular circuit simulators. A question which often crops up is which model is best to use when simulating a particular circuit? This is a complex question which requires careful consideration. One rule of thumb worth following is \textbf{always validate a SPICE/Qucs model before use}. Users can then check that a specific model does simulate the circuit parameters that control the function and accuracy of the circuit being designed\footnote{An interesting series of articles by Ron Mancini, on verification and use of SPICE models in circuit design can be found in the following editions of EDN magazine:Validate SPICE models before use, EDN March 31, 2005 p.22; Understanding SPICE models, EDN April 14, p 32; Verify your ac SPICE model, EDN May 26, 2005; Beyond the SPICE model's dc and ac performance, EDN June 23 2005, and Compare SPICE-model performance, EDN August 18, 2005.}. One way to check the performance of a given model is to simulate a specific device parameter.  The simulation results can then be compared to manufacturers published figures and the accuracy of a model easily determined.  By way of an example consider the simulation circuit shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp48}.  In this circuit the capacitors and inductors ensure that the devices under test are in ac open loop mode with stable dc conditions.  Figure~\ref{fig:opamp49} illustrates the observed simulation gain and phase results for four different OP AMP models.  Except at very high frequencies, which are outside device normal operating range, good agreement is found between manufacturers data and that recorded by the open loop voltage gain test for both the modular and Boyle macromodels.

\tutsubsection{The PSpice modified Boyle model}
One of the most widely used OP AMP simulation models is a modified version of the Boyle macromodel.  This was originally developed for use with the PSpice circuit simulator. Many semiconductor manufacturers provide models for their devices based on the modified Boyle macromodel\footnote{See for example the OP AMP section of the Texas Instruments (TI) Web site and the TI Operational Amplifier Circuits, Linear Circuits, Data Manual, 1990.}. A typical modified Boyle macromodel SPICE netlist is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp50}. The circuit structure and performance are very similar, but significantly different to the original Boyle model. Some of the common OP AMP parameters NOT modeled are (1) input offset voltage, (2) temperature coefficient of input offset voltage, (3) input offset current, (4) equivalent input voltage and noise currents, (5) common-mode input voltage range, and (6) temperature effect on component stability. Items (2), (4), (5) and (6) are also not modeled by the standard Boyle macromodel. Although the modified Boyle macromodel is similar to the original Boyle model it is not possible to use this model as it is defined with Qucs; due to the fact that SPICE 2G nonlinear controlled sources, egnd and fb, are included in the SPICE netlist. Controlled source egnd is employed to model the OP AMP reference voltage as the average of the VCC and VEE power rail voltages rather than the ground voltage assumed in the original Boyle macromodel\footnote{Taking the OP AMP reference voltage to be the average of VCC and VEE allows devices with non-symmetrical power supply voltages to be simulated.}. Current conrolled current source fb is used to model OP AMP output current limiting. The nonlinear polynomial\footnote{The definition of these polynomial functions was changed in the SPICE 3 series simulators to a more conventional algebraic form when specifying the B type source components.  This often gives compatibility problems when attempting to simulate SPICE 2 models with circuit simulators developed from SPICE 3f4 or earlier simulators. Most popular SPICE based circuit simulators now accept both types of nonlinear syntax.} form of controlled sources were included in the 2G series of SPICE simulators to allow behavioural models of summers, multipliers, buffers and other important functional components to be easily constructed. Single and multidimensional polynomial forms of controlled sources are defined by SPICE 2G. Taking (1) the voltage controlled voltage source and (2) the current controlled current sources as examples the syntax is as follows:

\verb|Ename N(+) N(-) POLY(n) NC1(+) NC1(-) NC2(+) NC2(-)..... P0  P1  P2......,| \linebreak where n indicates the order of the polynomial with coefficients P0 .....Pn, and NCn(+), NCn(-) etc are the control node pairs.
  
This becomes:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \begin{footnotesize}\verb|For POLY(1)|                         \end{footnotesize}\footnote{ If only one P coefficient is given in the single dimension polynomial case, then SPICE assumes that this is P1 and that P0 equals zero. Similarly if the POLY keyword is not explicitly stated in a controlled source definition then it is assumed by SPICE to be POLY(1).}\begin{footnotesize}\verb|: Ename N(+) N(-) P0 P1 P2.........|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \end{footnotesize}
 \item \begin{footnotesize}\verb|For POLY(2): Ename N(+) N(-) POLY(2) NC1(+) NC1(-) NC2(+) NC(-) P0 P1 P2......|                                                                                            \end{footnotesize}
 \item \begin{footnotesize}\verb|For POLY(3): Ename N(+) N(-) POLY(3) NC1(+) NC1(-) NC2(+) NC2(-) NC3(+) NC3(-) P0 P1 P2....                                                                                              |\end{footnotesize}, and so on.
\end{itemize}            



Similarly:
\begin{footnotesize}Fname N(+) N(-) POLY(n) V1 V2 V3 ...... P0 P1 P2 ....., where V1, V2 .... are independent voltage sources whose current controls the output.
\end{footnotesize}
This becomes:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \begin{footnotesize}For POLY(1): Fname N(+) N(-) V1 P0 P1 P2........
 \item For POLY(2): Fname N(+) N(-) POLY(2) V1 V2 P0 P1 P2.......
 \item For POLY(3): Fname N(+) N(-) POLY(3) V1 V2 V3 P0 P1 P2 P3......., and so on.                                                                    \end{footnotesize}
\end{itemize}


The meaning of the coefficients in the nonlinear controlled source definitions depends on the dimension of the polynomial. The following examples indicate how SPICE calculates current or voltage values.
\begin{itemize}
 \item For POLY(1): The polynomial function $fv$ is calculated using\linebreak 
$fv=P0+(P1*fa)+(P2*fa^{2})+(P3*fa^{3})+(P4*fa^{4})+.........$, \linebreak where $fa$ is either a voltage or current independent variable.
 \item For POLY(2): The polynomial function $fv$ is calculated using\linebreak 
$fv=P0+(P1*fa)+(P2*fb)+(P3*fa^{2})+(P4*fa*fb)+(P5*fb^{2})+(P6*fa^{3})$ 
$+(P7*fa^{2}*fb)+..........$, where $fa$ and $fb$ are both either voltage or current independent variables.
\item For POLY(3): The polynomial function $fv$ is calculated using\linebreak 
$fv=P0+(P1*fa)+(P2*fb)+(P3*fc)+(P4*fa^{2})+(P5*fa*fb)$
$+(P6*fa*fc)+(P7*fb^{2})+(P8*fb*fc)+(P9*fc^{2})+(P10*fa^{3})$
$+(P11*fa^{2}*fb)+(P12*fa^{2}*fc)+(P13*fa*fb^{2})+(P14*fa*fb*fc)$
$+(P15*fa*fc^{2})+(P16*fb^{3})+(P17*fb^{2}*fc)+(P18*fb*fc^{2})$
$+(P19*fc^{3}).............$, where $fa$, $fb$, and $fc$ are all either voltage or current independent variables.
\end{itemize}

From Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp50} the controlled generators egnd and fb are:
 
\begin{itemize}
 \item \verb|egnd 99  0 poly(2) (3,0) (4,0) 0 .5 .5| \linebreak Which is the same as \verb|egnd 99 0 poly(2) 3 0 4 0 0 0.5 0.5| \linebreak By comparison with the SPICE polynomial equations for controlled sources, \linebreak $V(egnd) = \dfrac{V(3)}{2}+\dfrac{V(4)}{2}$  implying that the controlled voltage source $V(egnd)$ is the sum of two linear voltage sources. 

 \item \verb|fb 7 99 poly(5) vb vc ve vlp vln 0 10.61E6 -10E6 10E6 10E6 -10E6| \linebreak  By comparison with the SPICE polynomial equations for controlled sources \linebreak \verb|I(fb) = 10.61e6*I(vb) - 10e6*I(vc) + 10e6*I(ve) + 10e6*I(vlp) -10e6*I(vlp)| implying that the controlled current $I(fb)$ is the sum of five linear controlled current sources.
\end{itemize}

SPICE sources engd and fb can therefore be replaced in the modified Boyle model by the following SPICE code\footnote{It is worth noting that the code for the polynomial form of controlled sources can only be replaced by a series connection of linear controlled voltage sources or a parallel connection of linear controlled current sources provided no higher order polynomial coefficients are present in the original SPICE code.  Some SPICE models use these higher order coefficients to generate multiply functions.  Such cases cannot be converted to code which will simulate using Qucs 0.0.10. Sometime in the future this restriction will be removed when nonlinear voltage and current sources are added to Qucs.}:

\begin{verbatim}

Modified Boyle macromodels are often generated using the PSpice Parts\footnote{The Parts modelling program is an integral component in the PSpice circuit simulation software originally developed by the MicroSim Corporation, 1993, The Design Centre:Parts (Irvine, Calif.). It now forms part of Cadence Design Systems OrCad suite of CAD software.} program.  Such models have similar structured SPICE netlists with different component values. However, changes in technology do result in changes in the input stage that reflect the use of npn, pnp and JFET input transistors in real OP AMPs.  Hence to use manufacturers published modified Boyle models with Qucs all that is required is the replacement of the SPICE polynomial controlled sources with linear sources and the correct component values. Again this is best done using a SPICE preprocessor template. The templates for OP AMPS with npn and PJF input transistors are shown in Figures ~\ref{fig:opamp51} and ~\ref{fig:opamp52}. The SPICE netlists shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:opamp53} and ~\ref{fig:opamp54} were generated by the PS2SP preprocessor.  For OP AMPS with pnp input transistors simply change the BJT model reference from npn to pnp and use the same template.

\tutsection{Constructing Qucs OPAMP libraries}
Qucs release 0.0.10 includes a facility which allows users to build their own component libraries. This facility can be used to construct any library which contains device models formed using the standard schematic entry route provided the individual components that make up a model do not contain components that require file netlists.  Qucs, for example, converts SPICE netlists to Qucs formatted netlists when a  simulation is performed but does not retain the converted netlists. Hence, to add OP AMP macromodels that are based on SPICE netlist to a Qucs library a slightly modified procedure is required that involves users copying the converted SPICE netlist into a Qucs library.  One way for generating SPICE netlist based OP AMP models is as follows\footnote{The procedure presented here must be considered a work around and may change as Qucs develops.}:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Construct a Qucs OP AMP model using the procedure described on page 3 of the \textit{Qucs Simulation of SPICE Netlists} tutorial.
 \item Add this model to a user defined library using the Qucs Create Library facility (short cut Ctrl+Shift+L).
 \item Place a copy of the OP AMP model on a drawing sheet and undertake a DC analysis. NOTE: drag and drop the model symbol of the device you are simulating from your current work project and NOT from the newly created Qucs library.
 \item Copy the section of the Qucs netlist that has been converted from the model's SPICE netlist and paste this into the newly created library model. The converted SPICE netlist can be displayed by pressing key F6. User generated library files are held in directory \verb|user_lib|.\footnote{The location of the user created libraries will differ from system to system depending where .qucs is installed.}
\end{enumerate}

 To demonstrate the procedure consider the following example based on the UA741 Boyle model:

 Steps 1 and 2 result in the following entry in a user created library:

\tutsection{Extending existing OP AMP models}
The modular, Boyle and modified Boyle OP AMP models are three popular macromodels selected from a large number of different models that are in common use today. Most device manufacturers provide similar macromodels, or extended versions which more accurately model the performance of specific devices.  Indeed, a growing trend has developed which mixes Boyle type models with modular structures\footnote{See for example: Ray Kendall, User-friendly model simplifies SPICE OP-AMP simulation, EDN magazine, January 4, 2007, pp. 63-69.}. Often, in practical design projects specific OP AMP properties must be simulated which are not modelled with an available OP AMP model. Two approaches can be used to overcome such deficiencies; firstly, a macromodel itself can be modified so that it models the required additional attributes, or secondly external components can be added which again extend model performance.


One important OP AMP parameter that the standard and modified Boyle models do not model is the frequency dependence of amplifier common-mode gain. Only the dc value of the CMRR is modelled. Such frequency dependency can be added by a simple modification\footnote{This section is based on unpublished work by David Faulkner and Mike Brinson., Department of Computing, Communications Technology and Mathematical Sciences, London Metropolitan University, UK.}, requiring one extra node, that simulates ac CMRR and gives close agreement between macromodel performance and data sheet specifications.  Components CEE, REE and GCM, see Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp45}, are replaced by the network shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp55}.  Data sheets for the UA741 show the CMRR falling above a break frequency of about 200 Hz, due to the zero generated by CEE causing the common-mode gain to increase.  This effect can be simulated in the Boyle macromodel by the addition of one extra node and two extra resistors and changes to REE and controlled source GCM as in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp45}. In this modified network, the common-mode voltage is detected at the junction of RE4 and CEE, introducing a zero into the response and attenuating the signal. The frequency of the zero is set by $\frac{1}{2*\pi*CEE*RE3}$. The new value of CEE must have the same value as the original CEE value\footnote{In the Boyle macromodel the value of CEE is set by the OP AMP slew rate. Adjusting both the positive and negative slew rates changes the value of CEE. For the UA741 these have been set at 0.625e6 and 0.500e6 respectively. This gives CEE=7.5pF which is commonly quoted for the UA741 value of CEE, see Andrei Vladimirescu, The SPICE Book,1994, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., ISBN 0-471-60926-9, pp 228-239. Also note care must be taken when choosing values for the two slew rates because negative values of CEE can occur which are physically not realisable.} if the same slew-rate is to be maintained, so for a 200 Hz cut-off this gives RE3=106.1M. RE4 is arbitrarily fixed at 10 $\Omega$, which introduces another pole at about 2 GHz, well outside the frequency of interest.  The value of REE is increased to RE5 (15.06meg), so that RE5 in parallel with RE3 equals the original value of REE.  GCM is also increased by the factor $\frac{RE3}{RE4}$ maintaining the correct low frequency common-mode gain. Differential frequency response and slew rate are unchanged by these modifications. The simulation results for the common-mode test circuit shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp20} are given in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp56}. These indicate close agreement between the modular and ac Boyle macromodels.

Modifying the circuit of an existing OP AMP macromodel is at best a complex process or at worst impossible because the model details are either not known or well understood. One way to add features to an existing model is to add an external circuit to a model's terminals.  This circuit acts as a signal processing element adding additional capabilities to the original macromodel. One circuit feature not modelled by any of the macromodels introduced in earlier sections is power supply rejection. By adding a simple passive electrical network to the terminals of a macromodel it is possible to model OP AMP power supply rejection.  Power supply rejection(PSRR) is a measure of the ability of an OP AMP to reject unwanted signals that enter at the power terminals. It is defined as the ratio of differential-mode gain to power supply injected signal gain. The simulation of OP AMP power supply rejection\footnote{M. E. Brinson and D. J. Faulkner, Measurement and modelling of operational amplifier power supply rejection, Int. J. Electronics, 1995, vol. 78, NO. 4, 667-678.} is possible using the test circuit given in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp57}, where

\medskip 
$V_{out}(f)^{\pm}=A_{D}(f)\left[ V^{+} - V^{-}\right] +A_{CM}(f)\left[ \dfrac{V^{+} + V^{-}}{2}\right] +A_{PS}(f)^{\pm}V_{S} $,

\medskip 
where $A_{D}(f)$ is the OP AMP differential-mode gain, $A_{CM}(f)$ is the OP AMP common-mode gain, and $A_{PS}(f)^{\pm}$ is the OP AMP power supply injected gain.  The superscript $\pm$ indicates that the ac signal source is connected to either the OP AMP positive or negative power supply terminals but not simultaneously to both.  Assuming that the OP AMP power supply injected gain has a single dominant zero at $f_{PSZ1}^{\pm}$, analysis yields

\bigskip 

$\dfrac{V_{OUT}(f)^{\pm}}{V_{S}}=\dfrac{\dfrac{1}{\alpha P_{SRR}(0)^{\pm}} \left[ 1+j\left( \dfrac{f}{f_{PSZ1}^{\pm}}  \right) \right] }                  {\left[ 1+j\left( \dfrac{f}{\alpha GBP} \right) \right] }$

\bigskip 

Where  $APS(f)^{\pm}=APS(0)^{\pm} \dfrac{\left[ 1+j\left( \dfrac{f}{f_{PSZ1}^{\pm}}\right) \right] }{\left[ 1+j\left( \dfrac{f}{f_{p1}}\right) \right] } $ ,  $\alpha=\dfrac{R2}{R1+R2} = 1e-4$


$PSRR(f)^{\pm} = \dfrac{PSRR(0)^{\pm}}   {\left[ 1+j\left( \dfrac{f}{f_{PSZ1}^{\pm}} \right) \right]}$, $PSRR(0)^{+}=\dfrac{A_{D}(0)}{A_{PS}(0)^{+}}$ and $PSRR(0)^{-}=\dfrac{A_{D}(0)}{A_{PS}(0)^{-}}$.

Typical values for the UA741 are $PSRR(0)^{+}=110000, PSRR(0)^{-}=170000,    f_{PSZ1}^{+}=685Hz, f_{PSZ1}^{-}=6.2Hz$.

  \caption{Test circuit for the simulation of PSRR(f) voltage transfer function characteristic}  
  \label{fig:opamp57}
\end{figure}
The considerable difference in the dominant zero frequencies of the  injected power supply gains is normally due to the fact that the OP AMP circuits are not symmetric when viewed from the power supply signal injection terminals. 
By adding external components to an OP AMP macromodel power supply rejection effects can be easily simulated.  The schematic shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp58} shows the TI UA741 model with RC networks connected between the power supply terminals and earth.  The voltage controlled voltage sources probe the voltages at the center nodes of the additional RC networks.  These networks generate the power supply injected signals at dc. They also generate the dominant zero in the power supply rejection characteristic.  
\begin{flushleft}
The values for the passive components can be calculated using:                                                                               \end{flushleft}
$RA=\dfrac{10^{6}}{PSRR(0)^{+}}$, $CA=\dfrac{1}{2 \cdot 10^{6} \cdot \pi \cdot f_{PSZ1}^{+}}$, $RB=\dfrac{10^{6}}{PSRR(0)^{-}}$, $CA=\dfrac{1}{2 \cdot 10^{6} \cdot \pi \cdot f_{PSZ1}^{-}}$

\bigskip
Which gives, for the example UA741 device data, $RA=9\Omega$, $CA=232pF$, $RB=5.9\Omega$ and $CB=25.7pF$.
Simulation waveforms for the small signal frequency response of the test circuit are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opamp59}.  In the case of the modular UA741 model the simulation signal plot clearly demonstrates the fact that the model does not correctly represent the effects due to power supply injected signals.

\tutsection{End note}
While writing this tutorial I have tried to demonstrate how practical models of operational amplifiers can be constructed using basic electronic concepts and the range of Qucs built-in components.  The modular OP AMP macromodel was deliberately chosen as the foundation for the tutorial for two reasons; firstly Qucs is mature enough to easily simulate such models, and secondly the parameters which determine the operation of the macromodel can be be calculated directly from information provided on device data sheets. Recent modelling development by the Qucs team has concentrated on improving the SPICE to Qucs conversion facilities. This work has had a direct impact on Qucs ability to import and simulate manufacturers OP AMP models. The tutorial upgrade explains how SPICE Boyle type OP AMP macromodels can be converted to work with Qucs. The Qucs OP AMP library (OpAmps) has been extended to include models for a range of popular 8 pin DIL devices. If you require a model with a specific specification that is not modelled by an available macromodel then adding extra functionality may be the only way forward.  Two procedures for extending models are outlined in the tutorial upgrade. Much work still remains to be done before Qucs can simulate a wide range of the macromodels published by device manufacturers.  With the recent addition of subcircuit/component equations to Qucs it is now possible to write generalised macromodel macros for OP AMPs.  However, before this can be done time is required to fully test the features that Stefan and Michael have recently added to Qucs release 0.0.11. This topic and the modelling of other OP AMP properties such as noise will be the subject of a further OP AMP tutorial update sometime in the future.  My thanks to David Faulkner for all his help and support during the period we were working on a number of the concepts that form part of the basis of this tutorial. Once again a special thanks to Michael Margraf and Stefan Jahn for all their help and encouragement over the period that I have been writing this tutorial and testing the many examples it includes.
