Description
===========

Qucs is a circuit simulator with graphical user interface.  The
software aims to support all kinds of circuit simulation types,
e.g. DC, AC, S-parameter and harmonic balance analysis.  For
details see homepage:

http://qucs.sourceforge.net


Requirements
============

Qucs needs Qt version 4.6 or later. For simplicity, the Qt configuration is
currently obtained through pkg-config, which you need to install in addition
to Qt.

On Debian, consider the qtscript5-dev and libqt5svg5-dev packages.

Installation
============

Unpack the distribution tarball:

    $ tar xvzf qucs-<version>.tar.gz               (using GNU tar)
    $ gzip -cd qucs-<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -   (using another tar)

Change into the source directory:

    $ cd qucs-<version>

Configure the source package for your system:

    $ ./configure

Now compile the package:

    $ make

Install Qucs:

    $ make install

You must have root privileges if you want to install the package in the
standard location (/usr/local) or in any location that is only writable
by root.

For further information on installing the package, please consult the
file INSTALL included in this distribution.

Please note:  Users of the FreeBSD OS may use a GNU make (probably gmake)
to compile and install the package.

Getting the latest Git snapshot
===============================

You can always get the latest Qucs version from our Git repository.
Please use an official release if you want to work with Qucs.  The Git
version might not even compile.

    $ git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/qucs/git qucs-git

Press 'Enter' when asked for a password.  Run `sh bootstrap' and `configure'
(see above) with the appropriate options.  Maintainance currently requires
Autoconf version 2.57 and GNU automake 1.7.0.
