.SH NAME
QucsPowerCombiningTool \- A power combiner synthesis tool.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qucspowercombining
[\fIOPTION\fR] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBQucs\fR is an integrated circuit simulator which means you are able
to setup a circuit with a graphical user interface (GUI) and simulate
the large-signal, small-signal and noise behaviour of the circuit.
After that simulation has finished you can view the simulation results
on a presentation page or window.

The software aims to support all kinds of circuit simulation types,
e.g. DC, AC, S-parameter, harmonic balance analysis, noise analysis,
etc.

\fBQucsPowerCombiningTool\fR is a synthesis tool focused on the design of power
combiners/dividers which is integrated into the \fBQucs\fR environment.
The GUI consists of a dialog which includes the design parameters of the combiner and
a graphical description of the combiner type in the dialog. After the synthesis is done,
the schematic is copied into the system-wide clipboard. In order to run a simulation, please create
a new schematic in \fBQucs\fR and then press CTRL-V (paste from clipboard). The schematic will be
inserted in \fBQucs\fR and ready for simulation.

The available power combiner types are: 
Wilkinson,
Multistage Wilkinson,
T-junction,
Branchline,
Double-box Branchline,
Bagley,
Gysel,
Travelling wave combiner
and Tree combiner
