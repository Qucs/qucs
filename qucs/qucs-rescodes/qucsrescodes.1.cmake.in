.SH NAME
QucsResCodes \- A Standard resistor color code generator for Qucs.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qucsrescodes
[\fIOPTION\fR] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBQucs\fR is an integrated circuit simulator which means you are able
to setup a circuit with a graphical user interface (GUI) and simulate
the large-signal, small-signal and noise behaviour of the circuit.
After that simulation has finished you can view the simulation results
on a presentation page or window.

The software aims to support all kinds of circuit simulation types,
e.g. DC, AC, S-parameter, harmonic balance analysis, noise analysis,
etc.

\fBQucsLib\fR is a program to manage Qucs component libraries. On the
left side of the application window the available libraries can be
browsed to find the wanted component.  By clicking on the component
name its description can be seen on the right side. The selected
component is transported to the Qucs application by clicking on the
button "Copy to Clipboard".  Being back in the schematic window the
component can be inserted by pressing CTRL-V (paste from clipboard).

\fBQucsResCodes\fR is a program to compute color codes for resistors
and resistance values for color codes. 
To obtain the color codes, simply enter the 
resistance and tolerance values and press the "To Colors" button.
Alternatively to obtain the resistance, 
select the appropriate color bands and press the "To Resistance" button. 
The program computes the closest standard 
resistor value. You can paste the computed resistor 
in the schematic (by pressing ctrl+v). Have fun! ;)
