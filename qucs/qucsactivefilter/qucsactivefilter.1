.SH NAME
QucsFilter \- A filter synthesis application.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qucsfilter
[\fIOPTION\fR] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBQucs\fR is an integrated circuit simulator which means you will be
able to setup a circuit with a graphical user interface (GUI) and
simulate the large-signal, small-signal and noise behaviour of the
circuit.  After that simulation has finished you will be able to
present the simulation results on a presentation page or window.

The software aims to support all kinds of circuit simulation types,
e.g. DC, AC, S-parameter, harmonic balance analysis, noise analysis,
etc.

\fBQucsActiveFilter\fR is the active filter synthesis tool used by Qucs.  
By use of an input dialog the user can create a filter which is then 
copied into the system-wide clipboard.  In \fBQucs\fR the user opens 
an empty schematic and presses CTRL-V (paste from clipboard). The filter
schematic is now inserted and can be simulated.

Available filter types are: Butterworth, Bessel, Chebyshev, Cauer.

Available topologies are: Sallen-Key, Multifeedback and Cauer.
