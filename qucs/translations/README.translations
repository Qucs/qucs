Qt translations
===============

Qucs uses the translation interface of Qt in order to internationalize
the software.  The translation files are automatically generated and
updated by Makefiles.  Each translation (the *.ts file) consists of
two parts:  The actual translation of Qucs and the translation of Qt's
standard dialogs.

The actual Qucs translation is named 'qucs_xx.ts' whence 'xx'
specifies the locale abbreviation (e.g. 'de' for German, or 'es' for
Spanish).  This type translation files may change as the source code
of Qucs changes as well.

The TS files can be updated by running:
  $ cd ~/git/qucs/qucs/
  $ ./bootstrap && ./configure
  $ cd ~/git/qucs/qucs/translations
  $ make qucs_.ts

This target will scan all source files and update the source text(s).

The translation of Qt's standard dialogs (e.g. file dialog) is named
'qtgeneric_xx.ts' with the same convention for 'xx' as the actual Qucs
translation.  These file do not change during development.  If the
appropriate 'qtgeneric_xx.ts' file exists it will be incorporated into
the final translations, otherwise not.  There is a template file named
'qtgeneric_untranslated.ts' which can be used as a starting point for
a new translation.  The file has been generated from Qt sources using
the following command.

	$ lupdate dialogs/qcolordialog.* dialogs/qdialog.* \
	  dialogs/qfiledialog.* dialogs/qfontdialog.* dialogs/qinputdialog.* \
	  dialogs/qmessagebox.* dialogs/qprintdialog.* \
	  dialogs/qerrormessage.* kernel/qfont.* kernel/qfontdatabase* \
	  widgets/qwhatsthis.* -ts qtgeneric_untranslated.ts

The German as well as French translation is supported by Trolltech,
any other languages can be done as described in this file using the Qt
Linguist tool.
