Here are listed all the hackers who helped creating this package:

Michael Margraf <Michael.Margraf@alumni.TU-Berlin.DE> for having the
	initial idea of writing a free circuit simulator.  Thanks for
	sharing his excellent microwave knowledge.  Also for partly
	implementing the noise simulation.

Jens Flucke <jens.flucke@gmx.de> for making up the first draft of the
	homepage.  Also for motivating the project.

Vincent Habchi, F5RCS <10.50@free.fr> for testing the simulator, giving
	good hints how to improve its functionality and initiating the
	coplanar issues.

Raimund Jacob  <raimi@lkcc.org> for wildly testing the application and
	for applying patches to CVS during my time in Munich.  Also for
	documenting the grammars used in Qucs's data files.

Gunther Kraut <gn.kraut@online.de> for his contributions to the equation
	solver evaluation.  Also for providing the exponential current
	and voltage source code as well as the file based source.

Helene Parruitte <parruit@enseirb.fr> for her Verilog-AMS interface using
	the adms application.  Thanks for implementing the HICMU/L2 v2.11
	and v2.22 device models and testing it.  Also for encouraging some
	changes in the simulator including the concept of so-called
	trans-capacitances in non-linear device models.

Bertrand Ardouin <ardouin@xmodtech.com> for allowing Helene to spend
	a significant amount of time of her internship at XMOD to implement
	the Verilog-AMS interface.  Also for letting her work to be
	published under the GPL.

Bastien Roucaries <roucaries.bastien@gmail.com> for the bondwire model
	implementations.

Mike Brinson <mbrin72043@yahoo.co.uk> for testing the EDD component
	during his modelling activities.  Also for the Verilog-A
	implementation of the modular operational amplifier.  Thanks for
	testing the SPICE to qucs converter and documenting the
	compatibilty levels.
